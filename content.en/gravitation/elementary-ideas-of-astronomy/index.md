Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences in the history of mankind. In the olden days, astronomy was an inseparable part of physical science. It contributed a lot to the development of physics in the {{< katex display >}}16^{\text {th }}{{< /katex >}} century. In fact Kepler's laws and Newton's theory of gravitation were formulated and verified using astronomical observations and data accumulated over the centuries by famous astronomers like Hippachrus, Aristachrus, Ptolemy, Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. Without Tycho Brahe's astronomical observations, Kepler's laws would not have emerged. Without Kepler's laws, Newton's theory of gravitation would not have been formulated.

It was mentioned in the beginning of this chapter that Ptolemy's geocentric model was replaced by Copernicus' heliocentric model. It is important to analyze and explain the shortcoming of the geocentric model over heliocentric model.



## Heliocentric system over geocentric system

When the motion of the planets are observed in the night sky by naked eyes over a period of a few months, it can be seen that the planets move eastwards and reverse their motion for a while and return to eastward motion again. This is called "retrograde motion" of planets.

Figure 6.25 shows the retrograde motion of the planet Mars. Careful observation for a period of a year clearly shows that Mars initially moves eastwards (February to June), then reverses its path and moves backwards (July, August, September). It changes its direction of motion once again and continues its forward motion (October onwards). In olden days, astronomers recorded the retrograde motion of all

**Figure 6.25 Retrograde motion of planets**

visible planets and tried to explain the motion. According to Aristotle, the other planets and the Sun move around the Earth in the circular orbits. If it was really a circular orbit it was not known how the planet could reverse its motion for a brief interval. To explain this retrograde motion, Ptolemy introduced the concept of "epicycle" in his geocentric model. According to this theory, while the planet orbited the Earth, it also underwent another circular motion termed as "epicycle". A combination of epicycle and circular motion around the Earth gave rise to retrograde motion of the planets with respect to Earth (Figure 6.26). Essentially Ptolemy retained the Earth centric idea of Aristotle and added the epicycle motion to it.

![](k2.png)

 **Figure 6.26 “Epicycle” motion of planetary objects around Earth, depicted with respect to months of observation.**

But Ptolemy's model became more and more complex as every planet was found to undergo retrograde motion. In the {{< katex display >}}15^{\text {th }}{{< /katex >}} century, the Polish astronomer Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model to explain this problem in a simpler manner. According to this model, the Sun is at the center of the solar system and all planets orbited the Sun. The retrograde motion of planets with respect to Earth is because of the relative motion of the planet with respect to Earth. The retrograde motion from the heliocentric point of view is shown in Figure 6.27.

Figure 6.27 shows that the Earth orbits around the Sun faster than Mars. Because of the relative motion between Mars and Earth, Mars appears to move backwards from July to October. In the same way the retrograde motion of all other planets was explained successfully by the Copernicus model. It was because of its simplicity, the heliocentric model slowly replaced the geocentric model. Historically, if any natural phenomenon has one or more explanations, the simplest one is usually accepted. Though this was not the only reason to disqualify the geocentric model, a detailed discussion on correctness of the Copernicus model over to Ptolemy's model can be found in astronomy books.


**Activity**

Students are encouraged to observe the motion of the planet Mars by naked eye and identify its retrograde motion. As mentioned above, to observe the retrograde motion six to seven months are required. So students may start their observation of Mars from the month of
June and continue till April next year. Mars is the little bright planet with reddish color. The position of the planet Mars in the sky can be easily taken
from ‘Google’.

## Kepler’s Third Law and The Astronomical Distance

When Kepler derived his three laws, he strongly relied on Tycho Brahe's astronomical observation. In his third law, he formulated the relation between the distance of a planet from the Sun to the time period of revolution of the planet. Astronomers cleverly used geometry and trigonometry to calculate the distance of a planet from the Sun in terms of the distance between Earth and Sun. Here we can see how the distance of Mercury and Venus from the Sun were measured. The Venus and Mercury, being inner planets with respect to Earth, the maximum angular distance they can subtend at a point on Earth with respect to the Sun is 46 degree for Venus and 22.5 degree for Mercury. It is shown in the Figure 6.28

Figure 6.29 shows that when Venus is at maximum elongation (i.e., 46 degree) with respect to Earth, Venus makes 90 degree to Sun. This allows us to find the distance between Venus and Sun. The distance between Earth and Sun is taken as one Astronomical unit (1 AU).

![](m2.png)

**Figure 6.28 Angle of elevation for Venus and Mercury from horizon**

The trigonometric relation satisfied by this right angled triangle is shown in Figure 6.29.

{{< katex display >}}
\sin \theta=\frac{r}{R}
{{< /katex >}}

where {{< katex display >}}\mathrm{R}=1 \mathrm{AU}{{< /katex >}}.

{{< katex display >}}
r=R \sin \theta=(1 A U)\left(\sin 46^{\circ}\right)

{{< /katex >}}

**Figure 6.29 Angle of elevation for Mercury from horizon**

Here {{< katex display >}}\sin 46^{\circ}=0.72{{< /katex >}}. Hence Venus is at a distance of {{< katex display >}}0.72 \mathrm{AU}{{< /katex >}} from Sun. Similarly, the distance between Mercury ( {{< katex display >}}\theta{{< /katex >}} is 22.5 degree) and Sun is calculated as {{< katex display >}}0.38 \mathrm{AU}{{< /katex >}}. To find the distance of exterior planets like Mars and Jupiter, a slightly different method is used. The distances of planets from the Sun is given in the table below.

**Table {{< katex display >}}6.2 \mathrm{a}^{3} / \mathrm{T}^{2}{{< /katex >}} for different planets**

| Planet | semi major <br> axis of the <br> orbit(a) | Period T <br> (days) | {{< katex display >}}\mathbf{a}^{3} / \mathrm{T}^{2}{{< /katex >}} |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Mercury | {{< katex display >}}0.389 \mathrm{AU}{{< /katex >}} | 87.77 | 7.64 |
| Venus | {{< katex display >}}0.724 \mathrm{AU}{{< /katex >}} | 224.70 | 7.52 |
| Earth | {{< katex display >}}1.000 \mathrm{AU}{{< /katex >}} | 365.25 | 7.50 |
| Mars | {{< katex display >}}1.524 \mathrm{AU}{{< /katex >}} | 686.98 | 7.50 |
| Jupiter | {{< katex display >}}5.200 \mathrm{AU}{{< /katex >}} | 4332.62 | 7.49 |
| Saturn | {{< katex display >}}9.510 \mathrm{AU}{{< /katex >}} | $10,759.20$ | 7.40 |

It is to be noted that to verify the Kepler's law we need only high school level geometry and trigonometry.


**Activity**

Venus can be observed with the naked eye. We can see Venus during sunrise or sunset. Students are encouraged to observe the motion of Venus and verify that the maximum elevation is at 46 degree and calculate the distance of Venus from the Sun. As pointed out already Google or Stellarium will be helpful in locating the position of Venus in the sky.

## Measurement of radius of the Earth
Around 225 B.C a Greek librarian "Eratosthenes" who lived at Alexandria measured the radius of the Earth with a small error when compared with results using modern measurements. The technique he used involves lower school geometry and

![](m7.png)

**Figure 6.30 Measuring radius of The Earth**

brilliant insight. He observed that during noon time of summer solstice the Sun's rays cast no shadow in the city Syne which was located 500 miles away from Alexandria. At the same day and same time he found that in Alexandria the Sun's rays made 7.2 degree with local vertical as shown in the Figure 6.30. He realized that this difference of 7.2 degree was due to the curvature of the Earth.

The angle 7.2 degree is equivalent to {{< katex display >}}\frac{1}{8}{{< /katex >}} radian. So {{< katex display >}}\theta=\frac{1}{8} \mathrm{rad}{{< /katex >}} ;

If {{< katex display >}}S{{< /katex >}}  is the length of the arc between the cities of Syne and Alexandria, and if {{< katex display >}}\mathrm{R}{{< /katex >}}  is radius of Earth, then

{{< katex display >}}
S=R \theta=500 \text { miles, }
{{< /katex >}} 

so radius of the Earth

{{< katex display >}}
\begin{aligned}
R & =\frac{500}{\theta} \text { miles } \\
R & =\frac{500}{\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)} \text { miles } \\
\mathrm{R} & =4000 \text { miles }
\end{aligned}
{{< /katex >}}

1 mile is equal to {{< katex display >}}1.609 \mathrm{~km}{{< /katex >}}. So, he measured the radius of the Earth to be equal to {{< katex display >}}\mathrm{R}={{< /katex >}} {{< katex display >}}6436 \mathrm{~km}{{< /katex >}}, which is amazingly close to the correct value of {{< katex display >}}6378 \mathrm{~km}{{< /katex >}}.

The distance of the Moon from Earth was measured by a famous Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the {{< katex display >}}3^{\text {rd }}{{< /katex >}} century BC.

**Activity**

To measure the radius of the Earth, choose two different places (schools) that are separated by at least {{< katex display >}}500 \mathrm{~km}{{< /katex >}}. It is important to note that these two places have to be along the same longitude of the Earth (For example Hosur and Kanyakumariliealong the same longitude of {{< katex display >}}77.82^{\circ} \mathrm{E}{{< /katex >}} ). Take poles of known length (h) and fix them vertically in the ground (it may be in the school playgrounds) at both the places. At exactly noon in both the places the length of the shadow (L) cast by each pole has to be noted down. Draw the picture like in Figure 6.30. By using the equation {{< katex display >}}\tan \theta=\frac{L}{h}{{< /katex >}}, the angle in radian can be found at each place. The difference in angle {{< katex display >}}\left(\theta^{\prime}\right){{< /katex >}} is due to the curvature of the Earth. Now the distance between the two schools can be obtained from 'Google maps'. Divide the distance with the angle {{< katex display >}}\left(\theta^{\prime}\right.{{< /katex >}} in radians) which will give the radius of the Earth.


## Interesting Astronomical Facts
1. On January 31, 2018 there was a total lunar eclipse which was observed from various places including Tamil Nadu. It is possible to measure the radius of shadow of the Earth at the point where the Moon crosses. Figure 6.31 illustrates this.

When the Moon is inside the umbra shadow, it appears red in color. As soon as the Moon exits from the umbra

**Figure 6.31 Total lunar eclipse**

shadow, it appears in crescent shape. Figure 6.32 is the photograph taken by digital camera during Moon's exit from the umbra shadow.

![](n2.png)

**Figure 6.32 Image of the Moon when it exits from umbra shadow**

By finding the apparent radii of the Earth's umbra shadow and the Moon, the ratio of the these radii can be calculated. This is shown in Figures 6.33 and 6.34.

![](n3.png)

**Figure 6.33 Schematic diagram of umbra disk radius**

The apparent radius of Earth's umbra shadow {{< katex display >}}=\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{s}}=13.2 \mathrm{~cm}{{< /katex >}}

The apparent radius of the Moon {{< katex display >}}=\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}={{< /katex >}} {{< katex display >}}5.15 \mathrm{~cm}{{< /katex >}}

The ratio {{< katex display >}}\frac{R_{s}}{R_{m}} \approx 2.56{{< /katex >}}

The radius of the Earth's umbra shadow is {{< katex display >}}R_{s}=2.56 \times R_{m}{{< /katex >}}

The radius of Moon {{< katex display >}}R_{m}=1737 \mathrm{~km}{{< /katex >}}

![](n4.png)

**Figure 6.34 Calculation of umbra radius**

The radius of the Earth's umbra shadow is {{< katex display >}}R_{s}=2.56 \times 1737 \mathrm{~km} \cong 4446 \mathrm{~km}{{< /katex >}}.

The correct radius is {{< katex display >}}4610 \mathrm{~km}{{< /katex >}}.

The percentage of error in the calculation

{{< katex display >}}=\frac{4610-4446}{4610} \times 100=3.5 \%{{< /katex >}}.

The error will reduce if the pictures taken using a high quality telescope are used. It is to be noted that this calculation is done using very simple mathematics.

Early astronomers proved that Earth is spherical in shape by looking at the shape of the shadow cast by Earth on the Moon during lunar eclipse.

2. Why there are no lunar eclipse and solar eclipse every month?

If the orbits of the Moon and Earth lie on the same plane, during full Moon of every month, we can observe lunar eclipse. If this is so during new Moon we can observe solar eclipse. But Moon's orbit is tilted {{< katex display >}}5^{\circ}{{< /katex >}} with respect to Earth's orbit. Due to this {{< katex display >}}5^{\circ}{{< /katex >}} tilt, only during certain periods of the year, the Sun, Earth and Moon align in straight line leading to either lunar eclipse or solar eclipse depending on the alignment. This is shown in Figure 6.35


**3. Why do we have seasons on Earth?**

The common misconception is that 'Earth revolves around the Sun, so when the Earth is very far away, it is winter and when the Earth is nearer, it is summer'. Actually, the seasons in the Earth arise due to the rotation of Earth around the Sun with {{< katex display >}}23.5^{\circ}{{< /katex >}} tilt. This is shown in Figure 6.36

Due to this {{< katex display >}}23.5^{\circ}{{< /katex >}} tilt, when the northern part of Earth is farther to the Sun, the southern part is nearer to the Sun. So when it is summer in the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere experience winter.

**Figure 6.36 Seasons on Earth**

**4. Star’s apparent motion and spinning of the Earth**

The Earth's spinning motion can be proved by observing star's position over a night. Due to Earth's spinning motion, the stars in sky appear to move in circular motion about the pole star as shown in Figure 6.37

**Note**
Pole star is a star located exactly above the Earth’s axis of rotation, hence it appears to be stationary. The Star Polaris is our pole star.

**Point to ponder**
Using Sun rays and shadows, How will you prove that the Earth’s tilt is 23.5° ?

## Recent developments of astronomy and gravitation

Till the {{< katex display >}}19^{\text {th }}{{< /katex >}} century astronomy mainly depended upon either observation with the naked eye or telescopic observation. After the discovery of the electromagnetic spectrum at the end of the {{< katex display >}}19^{\text {th }}{{< /katex >}} century, our understanding of the universe increased enormously. Because of this development in the late {{< katex display >}}19^{\text {th }}{{< /katex >}} century it was found that Newton's law of gravitation could not explain certain phenomena and showed some discrepancies. Albert Einstein formulated his 'General theory of relativity' which was one of the most successful theories of {{< katex display >}}20^{\text {th }}{{< /katex >}} century in the field of gravitation.

In the twentieth century both astronomy and gravitation merged together and have grown in manifold. The birth and death of stars were more clearly understood. Many Indian physicists made very important contributions to the field of astrophysics and gravitation.
Subramanian Chandrasekar formulated the theory of black holes and explained the life of stars. These studies brought him the Nobel prize in the year 1983. Another very notable Indian astrophysicist Meghnad Saha discovered the ionization formula which was useful in classifying stars. This formula is now known as "Saha ionization formula". In the field of gravitation Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri solved an equation now known as "Raychaudhuri equation" which was a very important contribution. Another notable Indian Astrophysicist Jayant V Narlikar made pioneering contribution in the field of astrophysics and has written interesting books on astronomy and astrophysics. IUCAA (Inter University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics) is one of the important Indian research institutes where active research in astrophysics and gravitation are conducted. The institute was founded by Prof. J.V. Narlikar. Students are encouraged to read more about the recent developments in these fields.
