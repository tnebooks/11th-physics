# DEGREES OF FREEDOM
 
 
## Definition
 
_The minimum number of independent coordinates needed to specify the position and configuration of a thermodynamic system in space is called the degree of freedom of the system._
 
**Examples:**
 
1. A free particle moving along the x-axis needs only one coordinate to specify it completely. So its degree of freedom is one.
 
2. A particle moving over a plane has two degrees of freedom.
 
3. A particle moving in space has three degrees of freedom.
 
Suppose if we have N number of gas molecules in the container, then the total number of degrees of freedom is f = 3N.

But, if the system has q number of constraints
(restrictions in motion) then the degrees of
freedom decreases and it is equal to f = 3N-q
where N is the number of particles.
 
## Monoatomic molecule
 
A monoatomic molecule by virtue of its
nature has only three translational degrees
of freedom.

Therefore f = 3
 
**Examples:** Helium, Neon, Argon
 
## Diatomic molecule
 
There are two cases.
 
**1. At Normal Temperature**
 
A molecule of a diatomic gas consists of
two atoms bound to each other by a force
of attraction. Physically the molecule can
be regarded as a system of two point masses
fixed at the ends of a massless elastic spring.

The center of mass lies in the center of the
diatomic molecule. So, the motion of the
center of mass requires three translational
degrees of freedom (figure 9.5 a). In
addition, the diatomic molecule can rotate

about three mutually perpendicular axes
(figure 9.5 b). But the moment of inertia
about its own axis of rotation is negligible
(about y axis in the figure 9.5). Therefore, it
has only two rotational degrees of freedom
(one rotation is about Z axis and another
rotation is about X axis). Therefore totally
there are five degrees of freedom.

$$(f=5)$$
 
**2. At High Temperature**
 
At a very high temperature, such as 5000 K, diatomic molecules possess additional two degrees of freedom due to vibrational motion (one due to kinetic energy of vibration, and the other is due to potential energy) (Figure 9.5c). So, there are seven degrees of freedom.
 
$$[ f = 7 ]$$
 
**Examples:** Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen.
 
## Triatomic molecules
 
There are two cases.
 
**Linear Triatomic Molecule**
 
In this type, two atoms lie on either side of
the central atom as shown in the Figure 9.6

![Alt text](figure9.6.png)**Figure 9.6** A linear triatomic molecule.

Linear triatomic molecule has three
translational degrees of freedom. It has two
rotational degrees of freedom because it is
similar to diatomic molecule except there is
an additional atom at the center. At normal
temperature, linear triatomic molecule
will have five degrees of freedom. At high
temperature it has two additional vibrational
degrees of freedom. So a linear triatomic
molecule has seven degrees of freedom.

 
**Example:** Carbon dioxide.
 
**Non-linear Triatomic Molecule**
 
In this case, the three atoms lie at the vertices
of a triangle as shown in the Figure 9.7

molecule

It has three translational degrees of freedom
and three rotational degrees of freedom
about three mutually orthogonal axes. The
total degrees of freedom, f = 6
 
**Example:** Water, Sulphur dioxide.
