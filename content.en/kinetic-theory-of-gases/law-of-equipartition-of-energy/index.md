We have seen in Section 9.2.1 that the average kinetic energy of a molecule moving
in the x-direction is $$\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 = \frac{1}{2}kT_x$$.
 
Similarly, when the motion is in the y-direction, $$\frac{1}{2}mv_y^2 = \frac{1}{2}kT_y$$, and for the motion along
the z-direction, $$\frac{1}{2}mv_z^2 = \frac{1}{2}kT_z$$.
 
According to kinetic theory, the average kinetic energy of a system of molecules in thermal equilibrium at temperature $$T$$ is uniformly distributed to all degrees of freedom (x, y, or
z directions of motion) so that each degree of freedom will get $$\frac{1}{2}kT$$ of energy. This is called
the **law of equipartition of energy**.
 
Average kinetic energy of a monatomic
molecule (with $$f=3$$) $$= 3 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = \frac{3}{2}kT$$.
 
Average kinetic energy of a diatomic molecule at low temperature (with $$f = 5$$)
$$= 5 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = \frac{5}{2}kT$$.
 
Average kinetic energy of a diatomic molecule at high temperature (with $$f =7$$)
$$= 7 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = \frac{7}{2}kT$$.
 
Average kinetic energy of a linear triatomic
molecule (with $$f = 7$$) $$= 7 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = \frac{7}{2}kT$$.
 
Average kinetic energy of a non-linear triatomic
molecule (with $$f = 6$$) $$= 6 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = 3kT$$.
 
## Application of the Law of Equipartition Energy in Specific Heat of a Gas
 
Meyer’s relation $$C_P - C_V = R$$ connects the two specific heats for one mole of an ideal gas.
 
Equipartition law of energy is used to calculate the value of $$C_P - C_V$$ and the ratio
between them $$\gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V}$$. Here $$\gamma$$ is called the adiabatic exponent.
 
**1. Monatomic Molecule**
 
Average kinetic energy of a molecule
$$= \frac{3}{2}kT$$
 
Total energy of a mole of gas
$$= \frac{3}{2} \times 3 \times kT N_A R T_A = \frac{9}{2} N_A R T_A$$.
 
For one mole, the molar specific heat at constant volume
$$C_V = \frac{dU}{dT} = \frac{3}{2}R$$,
 
$$C_P = \frac{dU}{dT} + P\frac{dV}{dT} = \frac{5}{2}R$$.
 
The ratio of specific heats,
$$\gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V} = \frac{5}{3} = 1.67$$.
 
**2. Diatomic Molecule**
 
Average kinetic energy of a diatomic molecule at low temperature $$= \frac{5}{2}kT$$.
 
Total energy of one mole of gas
$$= \frac{5}{2} \times 5 \times kT N_A R T_A = \frac{25}{2} N_A R T_A$$.
 
For one mole Specific heat at constant volume
$$C_V = \frac{dU}{dT} = \frac{5}{2}R$$,
 
$$C_P = \frac{dU}{dT} + P\frac{dV}{dT} = \frac{7}{2}R$$.
 
The specific heat of the mixture at constant volume
$$C_V = \frac{3}{2} \mu_1 R + \frac{5}{2} \mu_2 R$$.
 
The specific heat of the mixture at constant pressure
$$C_P = \frac{5}{2} \mu_1 R + \frac{7}{2} \mu_2 R$$.
 
{5}{2}kT N_A R T_A = \frac{35}{2} N_A R T_A.
 
For one mole Specific heat at constant volume
$$C_V = \frac{dU}{dT} = \frac{7}{2}R$$,
 
$$C_P = \frac{dU}{dT} + P\frac{dV}{dT} = \frac{9}{2}R$$.
 
The adiabatic exponent
$$\gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V} = \frac{9}{7}$$.
 
**b) Non-linear Molecule**
 
Energy of a mole
$$= \frac{6}{2}kT N_A R T_A = \frac{18}{2} N_A R T_A$$.
 
For one mole Specific heat at constant volume
$$C_V = \frac{dU}{dT} = \frac{7}{2}R$$,
 
$$C_P = \frac{dU}{dT} + P\frac{dV}{dT} = \frac{11}{2}R$$.
 
The adiabatic exponent
$$\gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V} = \frac{11}{7}$$.
 
Note that according to the kinetic theory model of gases, the specific heat capacity at constant volume and constant pressure are independent of temperature. But in reality, it varies with temperature.
 
**EXAMPLE 9.5**
 
Find the adiabatic exponent $$\gamma$$ for a mixture of $$\mu_1$$ moles of monoatomic gas and $$\mu_2$$ moles of a diatomic gas at normal temperature (27°C).
 
**Solution:** The specific heat of one mole of a monoatomic gas $$C_V = \frac{3}{2}R$$
 
For $$\mu_1$$ mole, $$C_V = \frac{3}{2} \mu_1 R$$, $$C_P = \frac{5}{2} \mu_1 R$$
 
The specific heat of one mole of a diatomic gas $$C_V = \frac{5}{2}R$$
 
For $$\mu_2$$ mole, $$C_V = \frac{5}{2} \mu_2 R$$, $$C_P = \frac{7}{2} \mu_2 R$$
 
The specific heat of the mixture at constant volume
$$C_V = \frac{3}{2} \mu_1 R + \frac{5}{2} \mu_2 R$$
 
The specific heat of the mixture at constant pressure
$$C_P = \frac{5}{2} \mu_1 R + \frac{7}{2} \mu_2 R$$
 
The adiabatic exponent
$$\gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V} = \frac{\frac{5}{2} \mu_1 + \frac{7}{2} \mu_2}{\frac{3}{2} \mu_1 + \frac{5}{2} \mu_2}$$
