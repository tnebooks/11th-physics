# LAW OF EQUIPARTITION OF ENERGY
 
We have seen in Section 9.2.1 that the average kinetic energy of a molecule moving
in the x-direction is \\(\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 = \frac{1}{2}kT_x\\).
 
Similarly, when the motion is in the y-direction, \\(\frac{1}{2}mv_y^2 = \frac{1}{2}kT_y\\) and for the motion along
the z-direction, \\(\frac{1}{2}mv_z^2 = \frac{1}{2}kT_z\\).
 
According to kinetic theory, the average kinetic energy of a system of molecules in thermal equilibrium at temperature T is uniformly distributed to all degrees of freedom (x, y, or
z directions of motion) so that each degree of freedom will get \\(\frac{1}{2}kT\\) of energy. This is called
the **law of equipartition of energy**.
 
Average kinetic energy of a monatomic
molecule (with f=3) \\(= 3 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = \frac{3}{2}kT\\).
 
Average kinetic energy of a diatomic molecule at low temperature (with f = 5)
\\(= 5 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = \frac{5}{2}kT\\).
 
Average kinetic energy of a diatomic molecule at high temperature (with f =7)
\\(= 7 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = \frac{7}{2}kT\\).
 
Average kinetic energy of a linear triatomic
molecule (with f = 7) \\(= 7 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = \frac{7}{2}kT\\).
 
Average kinetic energy of a non-linear triatomic
molecule (with f = 6) \\(= 6 \times \frac{1}{2}kT = 3kT\\).
 
## Application of the Law of Equipartition Energy in Specific Heat of a Gas
 
Meyer’s relation C_P - C_V = R connects the two specific heats for one mole of an ideal gas.
 
Equipartition law of energy is used to calculate the value of C_P - C_V and the ratio
between them \\(\gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V}\\). Here \\(\gamma\\) is called the adiabatic exponent.
 
**i). Monatomic Molecule**
 
Average kinetic energy of a molecule
$$= [\frac{3}{2}kT]$$
 
Total energy of a mole of gas
$$= \frac{3}{2} \times 3 \times kT N_A R T_A = \frac{9}{2} N_A R T_A$$
 
For one mole, the molar specific heat at constant volume
\\(C_V = \frac{dU}{dT} = [\frac{3}{2}R]\\)

$$C_V = [\frac{3}{2}R]$$
 
$$C_P = \frac{dU}{dT} + P\frac{dV}{dT} = \frac{5}{2}R$$
 
The ratio of specific heats,
$$\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{\frac{5}{2}R}{\frac{3}{2}R} = \frac{5}{3} = 1.67
$$
 
**ii). Diatomic Molecule**
 
Average kinetic energy of a diatomic molecule at low temperature =\\( \frac{5}{2}kT\\)
 
Total energy of one mole of gas
$$= \frac{5}{2} kT \times N_A = \frac{5}{2} RT
$$
(Here, the total energy is purely kinetic)
 
For one mole Specific heat at constant volume
$$C_v = \frac{dU}{dT} = \left[ \frac{5}{2} RT \right] = \frac{5}{2} R
$$
 
But$$ C_p = C_v + R = \frac{5}{2}R + R = \frac{7}{2}R$$
 
$$\therefore \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{\frac{7}{2}R}{\frac{5}{2}R} = \frac{7/5}{1} = 1.40$$.
 
Energy of a diatomic molecule at high
temperature is equal to \\(\frac{7}{2}\\)RT
$$C_v = \frac{dU}{dT} = \left[\frac{7}{2}RT\right] = \frac{7}{2}R$$.

$$\therefore C_p = C_v + R = \frac{7}{2}R + R$$

$$C_p = \frac{9}{2}R$$
 
Note that the CV and CP are higher for diatomic
molecules than the mono atomic molecules.
It implies that to increase the temperature of diatomic gas molecules by 1°C it require more
heat energy than monoatomic molecules. 
 
$$\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{\frac{9}{2}R}{\frac{7}{2}R} = \frac{9}{7} = 1.28$$

**iii) Triatomic molecule**

**a) Linear molecule**

Energy of one mole= \\(\frac{7}{2}kT \times N_A = \frac{7}{2}RT\\)

$$C_v = \frac{dU}{dT} = \frac{d}{dT}\left[\frac{7}{2}RT\right]$$

$$C_v = \frac{7}{2}R$$

$$C_p = C_v + R = \frac{7}{2}R + R = \frac{9R}{2}$$

$$\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{\frac{9}{2}R}{\frac{7}{2}R} = \frac{9}{7} = 1.28$$

**b) Non-linear molecule**

Energy of a mole =\\(\frac{6}{2}kT \times N_A = \frac{6}{2}RT = 3RT\\)

$$C_v = \frac{dU}{dT} = 3R$$

$$C_p = C_v + R = 3R + R = 4R$$

$$\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{4R}{3R} = \frac{4}{3} = 1.33$$

Note that according to kinetic theory
model of gases the specific heat capacity at
constant volume and constant pressure are
independent of temperature. But in reality it
is not sure. The specific heat capacity varies
with the temperature.

**EXAMPLE 9.5**
 
Find the adiabatic exponent γ for
mixture of μ1
 moles of monoatomic gas
and μ2
 moles of a diatomic gas at normal
temperature (27°C) .

 
**Solution:** The specific heat of one mole of a monoatomic gas \\(C_V = \frac{3}{2}R\\)
 
For \\(\mu_1\\) mole, \\(C_V = \frac{3}{2} \mu_1 R\\), \\(C_P = \frac{5}{2} \mu_1 R\\)
 
The specific heat of one mole of a diatomic gas $$C_V = \frac{5}{2}R$$
 
For \\(\mu_2\\) mole, \\(C_V = \frac{5}{2} \mu_2 R\\), \\(C_P = \frac{7}{2} \mu_2 R\\)
 
The specific heat of the mixture at constant volume
$$C_V = \frac{3}{2} \mu_1 R + \frac{5}{2} \mu_2 R$$
 
The specific heat of the mixture at constant pressure
$$C_P = \frac{5}{2} \mu_1 R + \frac{7}{2} \mu_2 R$$
 
The adiabatic exponent
$$\gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V} = \frac{\frac{5}{2} \mu_1 + \frac{7}{2} \mu_2}{\frac{3}{2} \mu_1 + \frac{5}{2} \mu_2}$$
