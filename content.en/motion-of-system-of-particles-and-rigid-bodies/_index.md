# INTRODUCTION

Most of the objects that we come across in
our day to day life consist of large number of
particles. In the previous Units, we studied
the motion of bodies without considering
their size and shape. So far we have treated
even the bulk bodies as only point objects. In
this section, we will give importance to the
size and shape of the bodies. These bodies
are actually made up of a large number of
particles. When such a body moves, we
consider it as the motion of collection of
particles as a whole. We define the concept
of centre of mass to deal with such a system
of particles. 

The forces acting on these bulk bodies
are classified into internal and external 
forces. Internal forces are the forces acting
among the particles within a system that 
constitute the body. External forces are
the forces acting on the particles of a
system from outside. In this unit, we deal
with such system of particles which make
different rigid bodies. A rigid body is the
one which maintains its definite and fixed
shape even when an external force acts on it.
This means that, the interatomic distances 
do not change in a rigid body when an
external force is applied. However, in real
life situation, we have bodies which are
not ideally rigid, because the shape and
size of the body change when forces act on
them. For the rigid bodies we study here,
we assume that such deformations are
negligible. The deformations produced on
non-rigid bodies are studied separately in
Unit 7 under elasticity of solids.
