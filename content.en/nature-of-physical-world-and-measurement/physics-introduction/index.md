# PHYSICS-INTRODUCTION

The word ‘physics’ is derived from the Greek word “Fusis”, meaning nature. The study of nature and natural phenomena is dealt within physics. Hence physics is considered as the most basic of all sciences.

**_Unification and Reductionism are_** the two approaches in studying physics. Attempting to explain diverse physical phenomena with a few concepts and laws is unification. For example, Newton’s universal law of gravitation (in unit 6) explains the motion of freely falling bodies towards the Earth, motion of planets around the Sun, motion of the Moon around the Earth, thus unifying the fundamental forces of nature.

An attempt to explain a macroscopic system in terms of its microscopic constituents is **_reductionism_**. For example, thermodynamics (unit 8) was developed to explain macroscopic properties like temperature, entropy, etc., of bulk systems. The above properties have been interpreted in terms of the molecular constituents (microscopic) of the bulk system by kinetic theory (unit 9) and statistical mechanics.
