## SCIENCE—INTRODUCTION

The word **‘science’** has its root in the Latin verb **_scientia_**, meaning **_“to know”_**. In Tamil language, it is ‘அறிவியல்’ (Ariviyal) meaning **‘knowing the truth’**. The human mind is always curious to know and understand different phenomena like the bright celestial objects in nature, cyclic changes in the seasons, occurrence of rainbow, etc. The inquisitive mind looks for meaningful patterns and relations in such phenomena. Today’s modern science and technology is an offshoot of the understanding of nature. Science is the systematic organization of knowledge gained through observation, experimentation and logical reasoning. The knowledge of science dealing with non-living things is physical science (Physics and Chemistry), and that dealing with living things is biological science (Botany, Zoology etc.).

Curiosity-driven observations of natural happenings was the origin of science. The word **‘science’** was coined only in the 19th century. Natural philosophy was the earlier name given to science, when ancient civilization knew and practised astronomy, chemistry, human physiology and agriculture. Oral communication was the mode of conveying knowledge when writing systems were not yet developed. One of the oldest forerunners of scientific advancements, from astronomy to medicine, were the Egyptians. Scientific and mathematical excellence in India dates back to prehistoric human activity in the Indus Valley Civilization (3300 – 1300 BC(BCE).

According to part IV Article 51A (h) of Indian Constitution _“It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to develop scientific temper, humanism and spirit of inquiry and reform’’. This is the aim of_ our Science Education.
