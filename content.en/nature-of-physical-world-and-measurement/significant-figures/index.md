# SIGNIFICANT FIGURES

### Definition and Rules of Significant Figures

Suppose we ask three students to measure the length of a stick using metre scale (the least count for metre scale is 1 mm or 0.1 cm). So, the result of the measurement (length of stick) can be any of the following, 7.20 cm or 7.22 cm or 7.23 cm. Note that all the three students measured first two digits correctly (with confidence) but last digit varies from person to person. So, the number of meaningful digits is 3 which communicate both measurement (quantitative) and also the precision of the instrument used. Therefore, significant number or significant digit is 3. It is defined as the **number of meaningful digits which contain numbers that are known reliably and first uncertain number.

 Examples: The significant figure for the** digit 121.23 is 5, significant figure for the digit 1.2 is 2, significant figure for the digit 0.123 is 3, significant digit for 0.1230 is 4, significant digit for 0.0123 is 3, significant digit for 1230 is 3, significant digit for 1230 (with decimal) is 4 and significant digit for 20000000 is 1 (because 20000000=2 × 107 has only one significant digit, that is, 2).

In physical measurement, if the length of an object is l = 1230 m, then significant digit for _l_ is 4.

The rules for counting significant figures are given in Table 1.9.

**EXAMPLE 1.10**

State the number of significant figures in the following 

i) 600800 

ii) 400

iii) 0.007

iv) 5213.0 

v) 2.65 × 1024 _m_

vi) 0.0006032


**Solution:** i) four ii) one iii) one

iv) five v) three vi) four
