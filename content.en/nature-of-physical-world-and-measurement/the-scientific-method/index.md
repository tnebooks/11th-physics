# The Scientific Method


The scientific method is a step-by-step approach in studying natural phenomena and establishing laws which govern these phenomena. Any scientific method involves the following general features.

(i) Systematic observation 

(ii) Controlled experimentation 

(iii) Qualitative and quantitative reasoning

(iv) Mathematical modeling
 
(v) Prediction and verification or falsification of theories

**Example** 

Consider a metalic rod being heated. When one end of the rod is heated, heat is felt at the other end. The following questions can be asked on this observation

a) What happens within the rod when it is heated?

b) How does the heat reach the other end?

c) Is this effect true for all materials?

d) If heat flows through the material, is it possible to visualize heat?

The process of finding the answers to these queries is scientific investigation.

The basic phenomenon of heat is discussed in unit 8.
