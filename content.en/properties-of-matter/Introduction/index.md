# INTRODUCTION

One of the oldest dams in the world is Kallanai (கல்லணை) located at Trichy. Kallanai was built across river Kaveri for the purpose of irrigation. During heavy floods, the velocity of water is generally very high in river Kaveri. The stability and utility of Kallanai dam reveal the intuitive scientific understanding of Tamils who designed this dam as early as 2nd century AD. The other example known for insightful constructions of the past is the pyramids in Egypt. The flyovers and overbridges are common worldwide today. Heavy vehicles ply over and hence, the bridges are always under stress. Without effective design using suitable materials, the bridges and flyovers will not be stable.

The growth of human civilization is due to the understanding of various forms of matter (solid, liquid, and gas). The study of properties of matter is very essential in selecting a material for a specific application. For example, in technology, the materials used for space applications should be of lightweight but should be strong. Materials used for artificial human organ replacements should be biocompatible. Artificial body fluids are used as tissue substitute for radiotherapy analysis in medicine. Fluids used as lubricants or fuel should possess certain properties. Such salient macroscopic properties are decided by the microscopic phenomena within matter. This unit deals with the properties of solids and fluids and the laws governing the behaviour of matter.
