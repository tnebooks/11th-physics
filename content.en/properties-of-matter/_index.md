<!-- ## INTRODUCTION -->

<!-- ![ Kallanai (கல்லணை)](img1.png) -->

<!-- 
One of the oldest dams in the world is Kallanai (கல்லணை) located at Trichy. Kallanai was built across river Kaveri for the purpose of irrigation. During heavy floods, the velocity of water is generally very high in river Kaveri. The stability and utility of 
Kallanai dam reveal the intuitive scientific understanding of Tamils who designed this dam as early as 2nd century AD. The other example known for insightful constructions of the past is the pyramids in Egypt. The flyovers and overbridges are common worldwide today. Heavy vehicles ply over and hence, the bridges are always under stress. Without effective design using suitable materials, the bridges and flyovers will not be stable.

The growth of human civilization is due to the understanding of various forms of matter (solid, liquid, and gas).

The study of properties of matter is very essential in selecting a material for a specific application. For example, in technology, the materials used for space applications should be of lightweight but should be strong. Materials used for artificial human organ replacements should be biocompatible. Artificial body fluids are used as tissue substitute for radiotherapy analysis in medicine. Fluids used as lubricants or fuel should possess certain properties. Such salient macroscopic properties are decided by the microscopic phenomena within matter. This unit deals with the properties of solids and fluids and the laws governing the behaviour of matter. -->


<!-- ##  MICROSCOPIC UNDERSTANDING OF VARIOUS STATES OF MATTER -->


<!-- ![Alt text](img2.png) -->


<!-- Even though various forms of matter such as solid food, liquids like water, and the air that we breathe are familiar in the day – to – day lifestyle for the past several thousand years, the microscopic understanding of solids, liquids, and gases was established only in 20th century. In the universe, everything is made up of atoms. If so, why the same materials exist in three states? For example, water exists in three forms as solid ice, liquid water, and gaseous steam. Interestingly ice, water, and steam are made up of same water molecules; two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom form a water molecule. Physics helps us to explore this beauty of nature at the microscopic level. The distance between  the atoms or molecules determines whether it exists in solid, liquid or gaseous state.

**Solids**
 
 In solids, atoms or molecules are tightly fixed. In the solid formation, atoms get bound together through various types of bonding. Due to the interaction between the atoms, they position themselves at a particular interatomic distance. This position of atoms in this bound condition is called their mean positions.

**Liquids**

 When the solid is not given any external energy such as heat, it will remain as a solid due to the bonding between atoms. When heated, atoms of the solid receive thermal energy and vibrate about their mean positions. When the solid is heated above its melting point, the heat energy will break the bonding between atoms and eventually the atoms receive enough energy and wander around. Here also the intermolecular (or interatomic) forces are important, but the molecules will have enough energy to move around, which makes the structure mobile.

**Gases** 

When a liquid is heated at constant pressure to its boiling point or when the pressure is reduced at a constant temperature it will convert to a gas. This process of a liquid changing to a gas is called evaporation. The gas molecules have either very weak bonds or no bonds at all. This enables them to move freely and quickly. Hence, the gas will conform to the shape of its container and also will expand to fill the container. The transition from solid to liquid to gaseous states with the variation in external energy is schematically shown in Figure 7.1. -->

<!-- In addition to the three physical states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas), in extreme environments,matter can exist in other states such as plasma, Bose-Einstein condensates. Additional states, such as quark-gluon plasmas are also believed to be possible. A major part of the atomic matter of the universe is hot plasma in the form of rarefied interstellar medium and dense stars. -->

<!-- 
In the study of Newtonian mechanics (Volume 1), we assumed the objects to be either as point masses or perfect rigid bodies (collection of point masses). Both these are idealized models. In rigid bodies, changes in the shape of the bodies are so small that they are neglected. In real materials, when a force is applied on the objects, there could be some deformations due to the applied force. It is very important to know how materials behave when a deforming force is applied.   -->

<!-- ###  Elastic behaviour of materials -->

## Elastic behaviour of materials -->
<!-- ![Alt text](imagggg.png) -->

<!-- In a solid, interatomic forces bind two or more atoms together and the atoms occupy the positions of stable equilibrium. When a deforming force is applied on a body, its atoms are pulled apart or pushed closer. When the deforming force is removed, interatomic forces of attraction or repulsion restore the atoms to their equilibrium positions. **If a body regains its original shape and size after the removal of deforming force, it is said to be elastic and the property is called elasticity. The force which changes the size** or shape of a body is called a deforming force.
**Examples:** Rubber, metals, steel ropes.

![Alt text](img4.png)
 
**Figure 7.2** Elasticity

**Plasticity: 
If a body does not regain its original shape and size after removal of the deforming force, it is said to be a plastic body and the property is called plasticity. 
Example**: Glass -->


<!-- 
### Stress and strain -->

<!-- ![Alt text](IMGG.png) -->
<!-- 
**(a) Stress:** When a force is applied, the size or shape or both may change due to the change in relative positions of atoms or molecules. 
This deformation may not be noticeable to our naked eyes but it exists in the material itself. When a body is subjected to such a deforming force, internal force is developed in it, called as restoring force. The force per unit area is called as stress.

{{< katex display >}}
Stress,\sigma = \frac{Force}{Area} = \frac{F}{A}             (7.1)
{{< /katex >}} -->

<!-- Stress,\( \sigma = \frac{Force}{Area} = \frac{F}{A} \)            (7.1) -->


<!-- The SI unit of stress is N m<sup>–2</sup> or pascal (Pa) and its dimension is [ML<sup>–1</sup>T<sup>–2</sup>\]. Stress is a tensor. 

**(i) Longitudinal stress and shearing stress:**

Let us consider a body as shown in Figure 7.3. When many forces act on the system (body), the center of mass (defined in unit 5) remains at rest. However, the body gets deformed due to these forces and so the internal forces appear. Let ∆A be the cross sectional area of the body. The parts of the body on two sides of ∆A exert internal forces \( \vec{F} \) and  \( -\vec{F} \) on each other which is due to deformation. The force can be resolved in two components; \(F_n \) normal to the surface ∆A (perpendicular to the surface) and \(F_t \) tangential to the surface ∆A (tangent to the surface). The normal stress or longitudinal stress \( \sigma_n \) over the area is defined as



{{< katex display >}}
 \sigma_n = \frac{F_n}{\Delta A}
{{< /katex >}} -->
 <!-- \[\sigma_n = \frac{F_n}{\Delta A} \] -->

<!-- ![Alt text](img6.png)

**Figure 7.3** Longitudinal stress


Similarly, the tangential stress or shearing stress σt over the area is defined as


{{< katex display >}}
\sigma_t = \frac{F_t}{\Delta A} 
{{< /katex >}} -->
<!-- 
 \[ \sigma_t = \frac{F_t}{\Delta A} \] -->

<!-- 
Longitudinal stress can be classified into two types, tensile stress and compressive stress.

**Tensile stress** 
Internal forces on the two sides of ∆A may pull each other, i.e., it is stretched by equal and opposite forces. Then, the longitudinal stress is called tensile stress.

![Alt text](img5.png)
**Figure 7.4** Tensile stress -->





<!-- **Compressive stress** When forces acting on the two sides of ∆A push each other, ∆A is pushed by equal and opposite forces at the two ends. In this case, ∆A is said to be under compression. Then, the longitudinal stress is called compressive stress.


![Alt text](img7.png)
**Figure 7.5** Compressive stress

**(ii) Volume stress** 
This happens when a body is acted by forces everywhere on the surface such that the force at any point is normal to the surface and the magnitude of the force on a small surface area is proportional to the area. For instance, when a solid is immersed in a fluid, the pressure at the location of the solid is P, the force on any area ∆A is

{{< katex display >}}
F = P \Delta A 
{{< /katex >}} -->
<!-- \[ F = P \Delta A \] -->
<!-- Where, F is perpendicular to the area. Thus, force per unit area is called volume stress.

{{< katex display >}}
\sigma_v = \frac{F}{A} 
{{< /katex >}} -->

<!-- \[ \sigma_v = \frac{F}{A} \] -->

<!-- which is the same as the pressure.

**(b) Strain:** 
Strain measures how much an object is stretched or deformed when a force is applied. Strain deals with the fractional change in the size of the object, in other words, strain measures the degree of deformation. As an example, in one dimension, consider a rod of length _L_ when it stretches to a new length ∆L then

{{< katex display >}}
Strain, \varepsilon = \frac{Change \ in \ size}{Original \ size} = \frac{\Delta L}{L}  (7.2)
{{< /katex >}} -->

<!-- Strain, \(\varepsilon = \frac{Change \ in \ size}{Original \ size} = \frac{\Delta L}{L} \) (7.2) -->

<!-- ε is a dimensionless quantity and has no unit. Strain is classified into three types.

**(1) Longitudinal strain** 
When a rod of length _L_ is pulled by equal and opposite forces, the longitudinal strain is defined as



{{< katex display >}}
 \varepsilon_1 =  \frac{Increase \ in \ length \ of \ therod}{Original \ or \ natural \ length \ of \ therod} = \frac{\Delta L}{L}  (7.3)
{{< /katex >}} -->

<!-- \( \varepsilon_1 =  \frac{Increase \ in \ length \ of \ therod}{Original \ or \ natural \ length \ of \ therod} = \frac{\Delta L}{L} \) (7.3) -->



<!-- Longitudinal strain can be classified into two types  

**(i) Tensile strain:** If the length is increased from its natural length then it is known as tensile strain.

**(ii) Compressive strain:** If the length is decreased from its natural length then it is known as compressive strain.

**(2) Shearing strain** Consider a cuboid as shown in Figure 7.6. Let us assume that the body remains in translational and rotational equilibrium. Let us apply the tangential force F along AD such that the cuboid deforms as shown in Figure 7.6. Hence, shearing strain or shear is \( \varepsilon_s \)


![Alt text](img8.png)

**Figure 7.6** Shearing strain -->


<!-- {{< katex display >}}
 \varepsilon_s = \frac{AA'}{BZ} = \frac{x}{h} = \tan \theta         (7.4)
{{< /katex >}} -->
<!-- \(\varepsilon_s = \frac{AA'}{BZ} = \frac{x}{h} = \tan \theta \)        (7.4) -->

<!-- For small angle, tanθ ≈ θ Therefore, shearing strain or shear,

{{< katex display >}}
 \varepsilon_s = \frac{x}{h} = \theta =Angle \ of \ shear 
{{< /katex >}} -->
<!-- \( \varepsilon_s = \frac{x}{h} = \theta =Angle \ of \ shear \) -->


<!-- **(3) Volume strain** 
If the body is subjected to a volume stress, the volume will change. Let _V_ be the original volume of the body before stress and _V +_ ∆V be the change in volume due to stress. The volume strain which measures the fractional change in volume is


{{< katex display >}}
 Volumestrain, \varepsilon_v = \frac{\Delta V}{V} 
(7.5) 
{{< /katex >}} -->
<!-- Volume strain,\( \varepsilon_v = \frac{\Delta V}{V} \)
(7.5) -->

<!-- **Elastic Limit** 
The maximum stress within which the body regains its original size and shape after the
removal of deforming force is called the elastic limit.

If the deforming force exceeds the elastic limit, the body acquires a permanent deformation. For example, rubber band loses its elasticity if pulled apart too much. It changes its size and becomes misfit to be used again. -->


<!-- ![Alt text](IMGGG.png) -->
<!-- ###  Hooke’s law and its experimental verification


Hooke’s law states that for a small deformation within the elastic limit, the strain produced in a body is directly proportional to the stress that produces it.

It can be verified in a simple way by stretching a thin straight wire (stretches like spring) of length L and uniform cross- sectional area A suspended from a fixed point O. A pan and a pointer are attached at the free end of the wire as shown in Figure 7.7 (a).

The extension produced on the wire is measured using a vernier scale arrangement. The experiment shows that for a given load, the corresponding stretching force is F and the elongation produced on the wire is ΔL. It is directly proportional to the original length L and inversely proportional to the area of cross section A. A graph is plotted using F on the X- axis and ΔL on the Y- axis. This graph is a straight line passing through the origin as shown in Figure 7.7 (b).

 \frac{F}{A}  ∝  (\frac{\Delta L}{L}) 
{{< /katex >}} -->
<!-- \( \frac{F}{A} \) ∝ \( (\frac{\Delta L}{L}) \) -->



<!-- Comparing with equation (7.1) and equation (7.2), we get equation (7.5) as

σ ∝ ε

i.e., the stress is proportional to the strain in the elastic limit.

**Stress – Strain profile curve:** 
The stress versus strain profile is a plot in which stress and strain are noted for each load and a graph is drawn taking strain along the X-axis and stress along the Y-axis. The elastic characteristics of the materials can be analyzed from the stress-strain profile.

<!-- **(a) Portion OA:** 
In this region, stress is very small such that stress is proportional to strain, which means Hooke’s law is valid. The point A is called limit _of proportionality_ because above this point Hooke’s law is not valid. The slope of the line OA gives the Young’s modulus of the wire.

**(b) Portion AB:** 
This region is reached if the stress is increased by a very small amount. In this region, stress is not proportional to the strain. But once the stretching force is removed, the wire will regain its original length. This behaviour ends at point B and hence, the point B is known as yield point (elastic limit). The elastic behaviour of the material (here wire) in stress-strain curve is OAB.

**(c) Portion BC:** 
If the wire is stretched beyond the point B (elastic limit), stress increases and the wire will not regain its original length after the removal of stretching force.

**(d) Portion CD:**
 With further increase in stress (beyond the point C), the strain increases rapidly and reaches the point D. Beyond D, the strain increases even when the load is removed and breaks (ruptures) at the point E. Therefore, the maximum stress (here D) beyond which the wire breaks is called _breaking stress_ or _tensile strength. The corresponding point D is known_ as fracture point. The region BCDE represents the plastic behaviour of the material of the wire. -->

<!-- known as modulus of elasticity. Its SI unit is N m<sup>–2</sup>or pascal and its dimensional formula is ML<sup>–1</sup>T<sup>–2</sup> .  

In this section, we shall define the elastic modulus of a given material. There are three types of elastic modulus.

1. Young’s modulus 
2. Rigidity modulus (or Shear modulus)
3. Bulk modulus

**Young’s modulus:** 

When a wire is stretched or compressed, then the ratio between tensile stress (or compressive stress) and tensile strain (or compressive strain) is defined as Young’s modulus.




{{< katex display >}}
Young modulus of a material =  \frac{\text{Tensilestress or compressivestress}}{\text{Tensilestrain or compressivestrain}} 
{{< /katex >}} -->

<!-- =  \( \frac{\text{Tensilestress or compressivestress}}{\text{Tensilestrain or compressivestrain}} \) -->
    
<!-- {{< katex display >}}

{{< /katex >}} -->

<!-- Y = \( \frac{\sigma_t}{\epsilon_t} \)   Or  Y = \( \frac{\sigma_c}{\epsilon_c} \) -->



<!-- **EXAMPLE 7.1**

Within the elastic limit, the stretching strain produced in wires A, B, and C due to stress is shown in the figure. Assume the load applied are the same and discuss the elastic property of the material.

<!-- 
Within the elastic limit, stress is proportional to strain (obey Hooke’s law). Therefore, it shows a straight line behaviour. So, Young modulus can be computed by taking slope of these straight lines. Hence, calculating the slope for the straight line, we get

Slope of A > Slope of B > Slope of C

Which implies,

Young modulus of C < Young modulus of B < Young modulus of A

Notice that larger the slope, lesser the strain (fractional change in length). So, the material is much stiffer. Hence, the elasticity of wire A is greater than wire B which is greater than C. From this example, we have understood that Young’s modulus measures the resistance of solid to a change in its length. -->

<!-- **EXAMPLE 7.2**
 

A wire 10 m long has a cross-sectional area 1.25 × 10<sup>–4</sup> m<sup>2</sup>. It is subjected to a load of 5 kg. If Young’s modulus of the material is 4 × 10<sup>10</sup> N m<sup>–2</sup>, calculate the elongation produced in the wire. Take g = 10 ms<sup>–2</sup>.

**_Solution_**

We know that  

{{< katex display >}}

{{< /katex >}} -->

 
<!-- \( \frac{F}{A} = Y \cdot \frac{\Delta L}{L} \) -->

<!-- {{< katex display >}}
 \Delta L = (\frac{F}{A})(\frac{L}{Y}) 
{{< /katex >}} -->
<!-- 
\( \Delta L = (\frac{F}{A})(\frac{L}{Y}) \) -->


<!-- {{< katex display >}}

<!--

<!-- 
**Bulk modulus:** 

The bulk modulus is defined as the ratio of the volume stress to the volume strain. -->

 <!-- **Bulk modulus, K =** -->
<!--

  Bulk modulus, K =

<!-- σₙ = \(\frac{Fₙ}{ΔA}\) = Δp -->

<!-- The volume strain is

 {{< katex display >}}
εᵥ = \frac{\Delta V}{V}

<!--

(7.7)
{{< /katex >}} -->

<!-- K = \(\frac{-σₙ}{εᵥ}\) = \(\frac{-ΔP}{\frac{ΔV}{V}}\)
(7.7) -->

<!-- The negative sign in the equation (7.7) means that when pressure is applied on the body, its volume decreases. Further, the equation (7.7) implies that a material can be easily compressed if it has a small value of bulk modulus. In other words, bulk modulus measures the resistance of solids to change in their volume.

For an example, we know that gases can be easily compressed than solids. This means that gases have small value of bulk modulus compared to solids.

**Compressibility** 
The reciprocal of the bulk modulus is called compressibility. It is defined as the fractional change in volume per unit increase in pressure.

From equation (7.7), we can say that the compressibility

 {{< katex display >}}
C = \frac{1}{K} = \frac{-εᵥ}{σₙ} = \frac{-\frac{\Delta V}{V}}{\Delta P}

**Figure 7.9** Lateral strain versus longitudinal strain

Suppose we stretch a wire, its length increases (elongation) but its diameter decreases (contraction). Similarly, when we stretch a rubber band (elongation), it becomes noticeably thinner (contraction). That is, deformation of the material in one direction produces deformation in another direction. To quantify this, French Physicist S.D. Poisson proposed a ratio, known as Poisson’s ratio.

**It is defined as the ratio of relative contraction (lateral strain) to relative expansion (longitudinal strain). It is denoted by the symbol µ.**

<!-- ## Applications of elasticity
 The mechanical properties of materials play a very vital role in everyday life. The elastic behaviour is one such property which especially decides the structural design of the columns and beams of a building.

As far as the structural engineering is concerned, the amount of stress that the design could withstand is a primary safety factor. A bridge has to be designed in such a way that it should have the capacity to withstand the load of the flowing traffic, the force of winds, and even its own weight. The elastic behaviour or in other words, the bending of beams is a major concern over the stability of the buildings or bridges.

For an example, to reduce the bending of a beam for a given load, one should use the material with a higher value of Young’s modulus of elasticity. It is obvious from Table 7.1 that the Young’s modulus of steel is greater than aluminium or copper. Iron comes next to steel. This is the reason why steel is mostly preferred in the design of heavy duty machines and iron rods in the construction of buildings.




  

**7.3**

Which one is more elastic? Rubber or steel? Steel is more elastic than rubber. If an equal stress

is applied to both steel and rubber, the steel produces less strain. So the Young’s modulus is higher for steel than rubber. The object which has higher Young’s modulus is more elastic. -->

<!-- **FLUIDS**

## Introduction


Fluids are found everywhere in the world. Earth,s surface has about two-thirds of water and one-third of land. Fluids are different from solids. Unlike solid, fluid has no defined shape of its own. As far as fluid is concerned, liquid has fixed volume whereas gas fills the entire volume of the container.

**Pressure of a fluid:** Fluid is a substance which begins to flow when an external force is applied on it. It offers a very small resistance to the applied force. If the force acts on a smaller area, then the impact will be more and vice versa. This particular idea decides yet another quantity called ‘_pressure_’.

Assume that an object is submerged in a fluid (say water) at rest. In this case, the fluid will exert a force on the surface of the object. This force is always normal to the surface of the object. If F is the magnitude of the normal force acting on the surface area A, then the pressure is defined as the ‘force _acting per unit area_’.  

_P F A_

\= (7.14)

Pressure is a scalar quantity. Its S.I. unit and dimensions are N m–2 or pascal (Pa) and \[ML–1T–2\] respectively.

Another common unit of pressure is atmosphere which is abbreviated as ‘atm’. It is defined as the pressure exerted by the atmosphere at sea level.

i.e., 1 atm = 1.013 × 105 Pa or N m–2. Apart from pressure, there are two more

parameters such as density and relative density (or specific gravity) which are used to describe the nature of fluids.

**Density of a fluid:** The density of a fluid is defined as its mass per unit volume. For a fluid of mass m occupying volume _V_, the density ρ=

_m V_

. The dimensions and S.I unit of ρ are \[ML–3\] and kg m–3, respectively. It is a positive scalar quantity.

Mostly, a liquid is largely incompressible and hence its density is nearly constant at ambient pressure (i.e. at 1 atm. pressure). In the case of gases, there are variations in densities with reference to pressure.

**Relative density or specific gravity:** The relative density of a substance is defined as the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of water at 4 °C. It is a dimensionless positive scalar quantity.

For example, the density of mercury is 13.6 × 103kg m–3. Its relative density is equal

<!-- ## Pressure due to fluid column at rest


A mountaineer climbing the mountain is able to experience a decrease in pressure with altitude. A person jumping into the swimming pool always realizes an increase in pressure with depth below the water surface. In both the cases, the pressure encountered by the mountaineer and diver is usually due to the hydrostatic pressure, because they are due to fluids that are static.

In order to understand the increase in pressure with depth below the water surface, consider a water sample of cross sectional area A in the form of a cylinder. Let _h_1 and _h_2 be the depths from the air-water interface to level 1 and level 2 of the cylinder respectively as shown in Figure 7.10(a). Let F1 be the force acting downwards on level 1 and F2 be the force acting upwards on level 2 such that F1 = P1 A and F2 = P2 A. Let us assume the mass of the sample to be _m_ and under equilibrium condition, the total upward force (F2) is balanced by the total downward force (F1 + mg). In other words, the gravitational force will act downward which is being exactly balanced by the difference between the force F2 – F1.  

F2 – F1= mg = FG (7.15)

Let ρ be the density of the water, then the mass of water available in the sample element is

_m=_ρ_V =_ ρ _A_ (_h_2_–h_1) _V=_A (_h_2_–h_1)

**Figure 7.10** (a) A sample of water with base area A in a static fluid with its forces in equilibrium

**_F2_**

**Fe=mg_F1_**

**Sample h2**

**Area**

Hence gravitational force,

FG = ρ _A_ (_h_2 _– h_1) _g_

On substituting the value of FG in equation (7.15)

_F_2=F1+m g _P_2_A_ \= _P_1_A_+ρ_A_(_h_2–_h_1)g

Cancelling out A on both sides,

_P_2 = _P_1 + ρ(_h_2–_h_1)g (7.16)

**Figure 7.10 (b) The pressure (P) at a** depth (h) below the water surface

**Water**

**Air Level 1**

**h**

**Pa**

**P**







  

If we choose the level 1 at the surface of the liquid (i.e., air-water interface) and the level 2 at a depth ‘h’ below the surface (as shown in Figure 7.10(b)), then the value of h1 becomes zero (h1 = 0) and in turn P1 assumes the value of atmospheric pressure (say Pa). In addition, the pressure (P2) at a depth becomes P. Substituting these values in equation (7.16), we get

_P_ = _Pa_ + ρ_gh_ (7.17)

Therefore, the pressure at a depth h is greater than the pressure on the surface of the liquid.

If the atmospheric pressure is neglected or ignored, then the pressure at a depth _h_ is

_P_ = ρ_gh_ (7.18)

For a given liquid, ρ is fixed and g is also constant, then the pressure due to the fluid column is directly proportional to vertical distance or height of the fluid column. This implies that the height of the fluid column is more important to decide the pressure and not the cross sectional or base area or even the shape of the container. **Hydrostatic Paradox**

When we talk about liquid at rest, the liquid pressure is the same at all points at the same horizontal level (or same depth). This statement can be demonstrated by an experiment called ‘hydrostatic paradox’. Let us consider three vessels of different shapes A, B, and C as shown in Figure 7.11. These vessels are connected at the bottom by a horizontal pipe. When they are filled with a liquid (say water), it occupies the same level even though the vessels hold different amounts of water. It is true because the liquid at the bottom of each section of the vessel experiences the same pressure.  

h A B C

**Figure 7.11** Illustration of hydrostatic parodox

The atmospheric pressure at a place is the gravitational force exerted by air above that

place per unit surface area. It changes with height and weather conditions (i.e. density of air). In fact, the atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation.

The decrease of atmospheric pressure with altitude has an unwelcome consequence in daily life. For example, it takes longer time to cook at higher altitudes. Nose bleeding is another common experience at higher altitude because of larger difference in atmospheric pressure and blood pressure. Its value on the surface of the Earth at sea level is 1atm.

1 atm pressure = 1.013 × 105 pa

Take a metal container with an opening. Connect a vacuum pump to the opening. Evacuate the air from inside the container. Why the shape of the metal container gets crumbled?

<!-- ## Pascal’s law and its applications


The French scientist Blaise Pascal observed that the pressure in a fluid at rest is the same at all points if they are at the same height. Pascal’s law states that _if the pressure in a liquid is changed at a particular point, the change is transmitted to the entire liquid without being diminished in magnitude_.

**_Application of Pascal’s law_ Hydraulic lift** A practical application of Pascal’s law is the hydraulic lift which is used to lift a heavy load with a small force. It is a force multiplier. It consists of two cylinders A and B connected to each other by a horizontal pipe, filled with a liquid (Figure 7.12). They are fitted with

**Figure 7.12 Hydraulic lift**

frictionless pistons of cross sectional areas A1 and A2 (A2 > A1).

<!-- ## Buoyancy


When a body is partially or fully immersed in a fluid, it displaces a certain amount of fluid. The displaced fluid exerts an upward force on the body. The upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object in a fluid is called upthrust or _buoyant force_ and the phenomenon is called _buoyancy_.

**Archimedes principle:** -->

<!-- **Figure 7.13** Archimedes principle

Fluid

**It states that when a body is partially or wholly immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upward thrust equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it and its upthrust acts through the centre of gravity of the liquid displaced.** upthrust or buoyant force = weight of liquid displaced.

**Law of floatation** It is well-known that boats, ships, and some wooden objects move on the upper part of the water. We say that they float. Floatation can be defined as the tendency of an object to rise up to the upper levels  

of the fluid or to stay on the surface of the fluid.

**The law of floatation states that a body will float in a liquid if the weight of the liquid displaced by the immersed part of the body equals the weight of the body.** For example, a wooden object weighs 300 kg (about 3000 N) floats in water displaces 300 kg (about 3000 N) of water.

If an object floats, the volume of fluid displaced is equal to the volume of the

object submerged and the percentage of the volume of the object submerged is equal to the relative density of an object with respect to the density of the fluid in which it floats. For example, if an ice cube of density 0.9 g cm–3 floats in the fresh water of density 1.0 g cm–3 then the percentage volume of an object submerged in

Submarines can sink or rise in the depth of water by controlling its buoyancy. To achieve this,

the submarines have ballast tanks that can be filled with water or air alternatively. When the ballast tanks are filled with air, the overall density of the submarine becomes lesser than the surrounding water and it surfaces (positive buoyancy). If the tanks are flooded with water replacing air, the overall density becomes greater than the surrounding water and submarine begins to sink (negative buoyancy). To keep the submarine at any depth, tanks are filled with air and water (neutral buoyancy).

**Examples of floating bodies:** i) A person can swim in sea water more

easily than in river water. ii) Ice floats on water. iii) The ship is made of steel but its interior is

made hollow by giving it a concave shape.   -->

<!-- # VISCOSITY


## Introduction -->


<!-- In section 7.3, the behaviour of fluids at rest is discussed. Successive discussions will bring out the influence of fluid motion on different properties. A fluid in motion is a complex phenomenon as it possesses potential, kinetic, and gravitational energy besides causing friction viscous forces to come into play. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the case of an ideal liquid to simplify the task. An ideal liquid is incompressible (i.e., bulk modulus is infinity) and in which no shearing forces can be maintained (i.e., the coefficient of viscosity is zero).

Most of the fluids offer resistance towards motion. A frictional force acts at the contact surface when a fluid moves relative to a solid or when two fluids move relative to each other. This resistance to fluid motion is similar to the friction produced when a solid moves on a surface. The internal friction existing between the layers of a moving fluid is viscosity. So, viscosity is defined as the property of a fluid to oppose the relative motion between its layers.

Consider three steel balls of the same size, dropped simultaneously in three tall jars each filled with air, water, and oil respectively. It moves easily in air, but not so easily in water. Moving in oil would be even more difficult. There is a relative motion produced between the different layers of the liquid by the falling ball, which causes a viscous force. This frictional force depends

η= _F A_

**Cause of viscosity:** Consider a liquid flowing over a horizontal surface with two neighboring layers. The upper layer tends to accelerate the lower layer and in turn, the lower layer tends to retard the upper layer. As a result, a backward tangential force is set-up. This tends to destroy the relative motion. This accounts for the viscous behaviour of fluids.

<!-- ## Streamlined flow -->


<!-- The flow of fluids occurs in different ways. It can be a steady or streamlined flow, unsteady or turbulent flow, compressible or incompressible flow or even viscous or non-viscous flow. For example, consider a calm flow of water through a river. Careful observation reveals that the velocity of water at different locations of the river is quite different. It is almost faster at the center and slowest near the banks. However, the velocity of the particle at any point is constant. For better understanding, assume that the velocity of the particle is about 4 meter per second at the center of the river. Hence it will be of the same value for all other particles crossing through this point. In a similar way, if the velocity of the particle flowing near the bank of the river is 0.5 meter per second, then the succeeding particles flowing through it will have the same value.

**When a liquid flows such that each particle of the liquid passing through a point moves along the same path with the same velocity as its predecessor then the flow of liquid is said to be a streamlined _flow. It is also referred to as steady or_** laminar flow. The actual path taken by the particle of the moving fluid is called a streamline, which is a curve, the tangent to which at any point gives the direction of the flow of the fluid at that point as shown in Figure 7.16. It is named so because the flow looks like the flow of a stream or river under ideal conditions.

**If we assume a bundle of streamlines having the same velocity over any cross section perpendicular to the direction of flow then such bundle is called a ‘tube of**  

**_flow’. Thus, it is important to note that any_** particle in a tube of flow always remains in the tube throughout its motion and cannot mix with liquid in another tube. Always the axis of the tube of flow gives the streamline. The streamlines always represent the trajectories of the fluid particles. The flow of **fluid is streamlined up to a certain velocity called critical velocity. This means a steady** flow can be achieved at low flow speeds below the critical speed.

## Turbulent flow


When the speed of the moving fluid exceeds the critical speed _v_c, the motion becomes turbulent. In this case, the velocity changes both in magnitude and direction from particle to particle and hence the individual particles do not move in a streamlined path. Hence, the path taken by the particles in turbulent flow becomes erratic and whirlpool-like circles called eddy current or eddies (Figure 7.17 (a) and (b)). The flow of water just behind a boat or a ship and the air flow behind a moving bus are a few examples of turbulent flow.

**Figure 7.16** Flow is steady velocity at any point in the liquid remains constant

v




  

**Figure 7.17 (a) turbulent flow around a** sphere (when v = vc) (b) turbulent flow around a sphere (when _v **>** vc_**)**

The distinction between the two types of motion can be easily demonstrated by injecting a jet of ink axially in a wide tube through which water flows. When the velocity of the fluid is small, the ink will move in a straight line path. Conversely, when the velocity is increased beyond a certain value, the ink will spread out showing the disorderliness and hence the motion becomes turbulent. The zig-zag motion results in the formation of eddy currents and as a consequence, much energy is dissipated. -->

<!-- ## Reynold’s number -->


<!-- We have learnt that the flow of a fluid becomes steady or laminar when the velocity of flow is less than the critical velocity vc otherwise, the flow becomes turbulent. Osborne Reynolds (1842-1912) formulated an equation to find out the nature of the

(a)

(b)  

flow of fluid, whether it is streamlined or turbulent.

_R vD c_ \=

ρ η

(7.21)

It is a dimensionless number called ‘_Reynold’s number_’. It is denoted by the symbol Rc or K. In the equation, ρ denotes the density of the fluid, v the velocity of the flowing fluid, D is the diameter of the pipe in which the fluid flow, and η is the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid. The value of Rc remains the same in any system of units.

**Table 7.3 To understand the flow of** liquid, Reynold has estimated the value of

R_c_ as follows

S. No. Reynold’s number Flow

1 Rc < 1000 Streamline

2 1000 < Rc < 2000 Unsteady

3 Rc > 2000 Turbulent

Hence, Reynold’s number Rc is a critical variable which decides whether the flow of a fluid through a cylindrical pipe is streamlined or turbulent.

In fact, the critical value of Rc at which the turbulence sets is found to be the same for geometrically similar flows. For example, when two liquids (say oil and water) of different densities and viscosities flow in pipes of same shapes and sizes, the turbulence sets in at almost the same value of Rc. The above fact leads to the Law of _similarity_ which states that when there are two geometrically similar flows, both are essentially equal to each other, as long as they embrace the same Reynold’s number. The Law of similarity plays a very important role in technological applications. The




  

shape of ships, submarines, racing cars, and airplanes are designed in such a way that their speed can be maximized.

## Terminal velocity


To understand terminal velocity, consider a small metallic sphere falling freely from rest through a large column of a viscous fluid. The forces acting on the sphere are (i) gravitational force of the sphere acting vertically downwards, (ii) upthrust U due to buoyancy and (iii) viscous drag acting upwards (viscous force always acts in a direction opposite to the motion of the sphere).

Initially, the sphere is accelerated in the downward direction so that the upward force is less than the downward force. As the velocity of the sphere increases, the velocity of the viscous force also increases. A stage is reached when the net downward force balances the upward force and hence the resultant force on the sphere becomes zero. It now moves down with a constant velocity.

**The maximum constant velocity acquired by a body while falling freely through a viscous medium is called the terminal velocity _v_t**. In the Figure 7.18, a graph is drawn with velocity along y- axis and time along x- axis. It is evident from the graph that the sphere is accelerated initially

**Figure 7.18** Velocity verses time graph

and in course of time it becomes constant, and attains terminal velocity (_v_t).

**Expression for terminal velocity:** Consider a sphere of radius _r_ which

falls freely through a highly viscous liquid of coefficient of viscosity η. Let the density of the material of the sphere be ρ and the density of the fluid be σ.

Here, it should be noted that the terminal speed of the sphere is directly proportional to the square of its radius.

If σ is greater than ρ, then the term (ρ _-_ σ_)_ becomes negative leading to a negative terminal velocity. That is why air bubbles

rise up through water or any fluid. This is also the reason for the clouds in the sky to move in the upward direction.

**Point to ponder**

i) The terminal speed of a sphere is directly proportional to the square of the radius of the sphere. Hence, larger raindrops fall with greater speed as compared to the smaller raindrops.

ii) If the density of the material of the sphere is less than the density of the medium, then the sphere shall attain terminal velocity in the upward direction. That is why gas bubbles rise up in soda water. -->

## Stoke’s law and its applications -->


<!-- When a body falls through a viscous medium, it drags the layer of the fluid immediately in contact with it. This produces a relative motion between the different layers of the liquid. Stoke performed many experiments on the motion of small spherical bodies in different fluids and concluded that the viscous force F acting on a spherical body of radius r depends directly on

i) radius (_r_) of the sphere ii) velocity (_v_) of the sphere and iii) coefficient of viscosity η of the liquid

Therefore F ∝ η η_x y z x y zr F k rv v_⇒ = , where _k_ is a dimensionless constant.

Therefore, F=kη rv

Experimentally, Stoke found that the value of k = 6π

F = 6πη _rv_ (7.23)

This relation is known as Stoke’s law -->

<!-- **Practical applications of Stoke’s law** Since the raindrops are smaller in size and their terminal velocities are small, remain suspended in air in the form of clouds. As they grow up in size, their terminal velocities increase and they start falling in the form of rain. This law explains the following:

a) Floatation of clouds b) Larger raindrops hurt us more than the

smaller ones c) A man coming down with the help of

a parachute acquires constant terminal velocity. -->

<!-- ## Poiseuille’s equation -->

<!-- 
Poiseuille analyzed the steady flow of liquid through a capillary tube. He derived an expression for the volume of the liquid flowing per second through the capillary tube. As per the theory, the following conditions must be retained while deriving the equation.

• The flow of liquid through the tube is streamlined.

• The tube is horizontal so that gravity does not influence the flow

• The layer in contact with the wall of the tube is at rest

• The pressure is uniform over any cross section of the tube

The above equation is known as Poiseuille’s _equation for the flow of liquid through a_ narrow tube or a capillary tube. This relation holds good for the fluids whose velocities are lesser than the critical velocity (vc). -->

<!-- ## Applications of viscosity -->
<!-- 

The importance of viscosity can be understood from the following examples. (1) The oil used as a lubricant for heavy

machinery parts should have a high viscous coefficient. To select a suitable lubricant, we should know its viscosity and how it varies with temperature \[Note: As temperature increases, the viscosity of the liquid decreases\]. Also, it helps to choose oils with low viscosity used in car engines (light machinery).

(2) The highly viscous liquid is used to damp the motion of some instruments and is used as brake oil in hydraulic brakes.

(3) Blood circulation through arteries and veins depends upon the viscosity of fluids.

(4) Millikan conducted the oil drop experiment to determine the charge of an electron. He used the knowledge of viscosity to determine the charge. -->

rises up to the leaves through the stem. They are mostly related to the free surfaces of liquids. Liquids have no definite shape but have a definite volume. Hence they acquire a free surface when poured into a container. Therefore, the surfaces have some additional energy, called as surface energy. The phenomenon behind the above fact is called surface tension. Laplace and Gauss developed the theory of surface and motion of a liquid under various situations.

The molecules of a liquid are not rigidly fixed like in a solid. They are free to move about. The force between the like molecules which holds the liquid together is called ‘_cohesive force_’. When the liquid is in contact with a solid, the molecules of these solid and liquid will experience an attractive force which is called ‘_adhesive force_’.

These molecular forces are effective only when the distance between the molecules is very small about 10–9 m (i.e., 10 Å). The distance through which the influence of these molecular forces can be felt in all directions constitute a range and is called _sphere of influence. The forces outside this_ range are rather negligible.

Consider three different molecules A, B, and C in a given liquid as shown in Figure 7.20. Let a molecule ‘A’ be considered well inside the liquid within the sphere of influence. Since this molecule interacts with all other molecules in all directions, the net force experienced by A is zero. Now consider a molecule ‘B’ in which three-fourth lies below the liquid surface and one–fourth on the air. Since B has more molecules towards its lower side than the upper side, it experiences a net force in the downward direction. In a similar way, if another molecule ‘C’ is chosen on the liquid surface (i.e, upper half in air and lower half in liquid),  

it experiences a maximum downward force due to the availability of more number of liquid molecules on the lower part. Hence it is obvious that all molecules of the liquid that falls within the molecular range inside the liquid interact with the molecule and hence experience a downward force.

**Figure 7.20 Molecules at different levels** of liquid

When any molecule is brought towards the surface from the interior of the liquid, work is done against the cohesive force among the molecules of the surface. This work is stored as potential energy in molecules. So the molecules on the surface will have greater potential energy than that of molecules in the interior of the liquid. But for a system to be under stable equilibrium, its potential energy (or surface energy) must be a minimum. Therefore, in order to maintain stable equilibrium, a liquid always tends to have a minimum number of molecules. In other words, the liquid tends to occupy a minimum surface area. This behaviour of the liquid gives rise to surface tension.

**Examples for surface tension.** Water bugs and water striders walk on the surface of water (Figure 7.21). The water molecules are pulled inwards and the surface of water acts like a springy or stretched membrane. This balance the weight of water bugs and enables them to walk on the




  

surface of water. We call this phenomenon as surface tension.

**Figure 7.21** Water striders can walk on water because of the surface tension of water

The hairs of the painting brush cling together when taken out of water. This is because the water films formed on them tends to contract to a minimum area (Figure 7.22).

**Figure 7.22** Painting brush hairs cling together due to surface tension

**Needle floats on water surface** Take a greased needle of steel on a piece of blotting paper and place it gently over the water surface. Blotting paper soaks water and soon sinks down but the needle keeps floating.

<!-- 
The floating needle causes a little depression; the forces Fs due to the surface tension of the curved surface are inclined as shown in Figure 7.23. The vertical components of these two forces support the weight of the needle. Now add liquid soap to the water and stir it. We find that the needle sinks.

Take a plastic sheet and cut out a piece in the shape of a boat (Figure 7.24). A tapering and smooth front with a notch at the back is suggested. Put a piece of camphor into the notch of the boat. Gently release the boat on the surface of the water and we find that the boat is propelled forward when the camphor dissolves. The surface tension is lowered, as the camphor dissolves and produces a difference in surface tension in the water nearby the notch. This causes the water to flow away from the back of the boat, which moves the boat forward.

<!-- ## Factors affecting the surface tension of a liquid -->


<!-- Surface tension for a given liquid varies in following situations (1) The presence of any contamination or

**_impurities considerably affects the force_** of surface tension depending upon the degree of contamination.

(2) The presence of dissolved substances can also affect the value of surface




  

tension. For example, a highly soluble substance like sodium chloride (_NaCl_) when dissolved in water (H20) increases the surface tension of water. But the sparingly soluble substance like phenol or soap solution when mixed in water decreases the surface tension of water.

(3) Electrification affects the surface tension. When a liquid is electrified, surface tension decreases. Since external force acts on the liquid surface due to electrification, area of the liquid surface increases which acts against the contraction phenomenon of the surface tension. Hence, it decreases.

(4) **_Temperature_** plays a very crucial role in altering the surface tension of a liquid. Obviously, the surface tension decreases linearly with the rise of temperature. For a small range of temperature, the surface tension at _Tt_ at _t_ ºC is _Tt_ = _T0_ (1− _α_ _t_)

Where, _T_0 is the surface tension at temperature 0ºC and _α_ is the temperature coefficient of surface tension. It is to be noted that at the critical temperature, the surface tension is zero as the interface between liquid and vapour disappear. For example, the critical temperature of water is 374ºC. Therefore, the surface tension of water is zero at that temperature. van der Wall suggested the important relation between the surface tension and the critical temperature as

which gives more accurate value. Here, _n_ varies for different liquids and t and tc denote

<!-- ## Surface energy (S.E.) and surface tension (S.T.) -->


<!-- **Surface Energy** Consider a sample of liquid in a container. A molecule inside the liquid is being pulled in all direction by other molecules that surround it. However, near the surface, a molecule is pulled down only by the molecules below it and there is a net downward force. As a result, the entire surface of the liquid is being pulled inward. The liquid surface thus tends to have the least surface area. To increase the surface area, some molecules are brought from the interior to the surface. For this reason, work has to be done against the forces of attraction. The amount of work done is stored as potential energy. Thus, the molecules lying on the surface possess greater potential energy than other molecules. This excess energy per unit area of the free surface of the liquid is called ‘_surface energy_’. In other words, the work done in increasing the surface area per unit area of the liquid against the surface tension force is called the surface energy of the liquid.

**Relation between surface tension and surface energy:** Consider a rectangular frame of wire ABCD in a soap solution (Figure 7.25). Let AB be the movable wire. Suppose the frame is dipped in soap solution, soap film is formed which pulls the wire AB inward due to surface tension. Let _F_ be the force due to surface tension, then

_F_ = (2T)_l_ here, 2 is introduced because it has two free surfaces. Suppose AB is moved by a small distance Δ_x_ to new a position _A_'_B_'. Since the area increases, some work has to be done against the inward force due to surface tension.

Work done = Force × distance = (2T _l_) (Δ_x_)

It should be remembered that a liquid drop has only one free surface. Therefore, the

surface area of a spherical drop of radius r is equal to 4π_r_2, whereas, a bubble has two free surfaces and hence the surface area of a spherical bubble is equal to 2 × 4π_r_2.

<!-- ## Angle of contact -->


<!-- When the free surface of a liquid comes in contact with a solid, then the surface of the liquid becomes curved at the point of contact. Whenever the liquid surface becomes a curve, then the angle between the two medium (solid-liquid interface) comes in the picture. For an example, when a glass plate is dipped in water with sides vertical as shown in figure, we can observe that the water is drawn up to the plate. In the same manner, instead of water the glass plate is dipped in mercury, the surface is curved but now the curve is depressed as shown in Figure 7.29




  

**The angle between the tangent to the liquid surface at the point of contact and the solid surface inside the liquid is known as the _angle of contact between the solid and the liquid_.** It is denoted by θ.

Its value is different at interfaces of different pairs of solids and liquids. In fact, it is the factor which decides whether a liquid will spread on the surface of a chosen solid or it will form droplets on it.

Let us consider three interfaces such as liquid-air, solid-air and solid-liquid with reference to the point of contact ‘O’ and the interfacial surface tension forces Tsa, Tsl and Tla on the respective interfaces as shown in Figure 7.26.

Since the liquid is stable under equilibrium, the surface tension forces between the three interfaces must also be in equilibrium. Therefore,

_T T T T T Tsa la sl_

_sa sl_

_la_

\= + ⇒ = −cos cosθ θ (7.29)

From the above equation, there are three different possibilities which can be discussed as follows. (i) If Tsa > Tsl and Tsa − Tsl > 0 (water-plastic

interface), then the angle of contact θ is acute angle (θ less than 90°) as cosθ is positive.

(ii) If Tsa < Tsl and Tsa − Tsl < 0 (water-leaf interface), then the angle of contact is  

obtuse angle (θ less than 180°) as cosθ is negative.

(iii) If Tsa > Tla + Tsl, then there will be no equilibrium and liquid will spread over the solid.

Therefore, the concept of angle of contact between the solid-liquid interface leads to some practical applications in real life. For example, soaps and detergents are wetting agents. When they are added to an aqueous solution, they will try to minimize the angle of contact and in turn penetrate well in the cloths and remove the dirt. On the other hand, water proofing paints are coated on the outer side of the building so that it will enhance the angle of contact between the water and the painted surface during the rainfall. -->

<!-- ## Excess of pressure inside a liquid drop, a soap bubble, and an air bubble -->


<!-- As it is discussed earlier, the free surface of a liquid becomes curved when it has contact with a solid. Depending upon the nature of liquid-air or liquid-gas interface, the magnitude of interfacial surface tension varies. In other words, as a consequence of surface tension, the above such interfaces have energy and for a given volume, the surface will have a minimum energy with least area. Due to this reason, the liquid drop becomes spherical (for a smaller radius).

When the free surface of the liquid is curved, there is a difference in pressure between the inner and outer the side of the surface (Figure 7.27).

i) When the liquid surface is plane, the forces due to surface tension (_T, T_) act tangentially to the liquid surface in




  

opposite directions. Hence, the resultant force on the molecule is zero. Therefore, in the case of a plane liquid surface, the pressure on the liquid side is equal to the pressure on the vapour side.

ii) When the liquid surface is curved, every molecule on the liquid surface experiences forces (_FT_, _FT_) due to surface tension along the tangent to the surface. Resolving these forces into rectangular components, we find that horizontal components cancel out each other while vertical components get added up. Therefore, the resultant force normal to the surface acts on the curved surface of the liquid. Similarly, for a convex surface, the resultant force is directed inwards towards the centre of curvature, whereas the resultant force is directed outwards from the centre of curvature for a concave surface. Thus, for a curved liquid surface in equilibrium, the pressure on its concave side is greater than the pressure on its convex side.

**Excess of pressure inside a bubble and a liquid drop:** The small bubbles and liquid drops are spherical because of the forces of surface tension. The fact that a bubble or a liquid drop does not collapse due to the combined effect

indicates that the pressure inside a bubble or a drop is greater than that outside it.

**1) Excess of pressure inside air bubble in a liquid.**

Consider an air bubble of radius R inside a liquid having surface tension T as shown in Figure 7.28 (a). Let P1 and P2 be the pressures outside and inside the air bubble, respectively. Now, the excess pressure inside the air bubble is ΔP = P2 − P1.

i) The force due to surface tension acting towards right around the rim of length 2π_R_ is F_T_ = 2π_RT_

**2) Excess pressure inside a soap bubble** Consider a soap bubble of radius _R_ and the surface tension of the soap bubble be _T_ as shown in Figure 7.28 (b). A soap bubble has two liquid surfaces in contact with air, one inside the bubble and other outside the bubble. Therefore, the force on the soap bubble due to surface tension is 2×2π_RT_. The various forces acting on the soap bubble are,

i) Force due to surface tension _FT_\=4π_RT_ towards right

ii) Force due to outside pressure, _FP_1 = _P_1π_R_2

towards right

iii) Force due to inside pressure, _FP_2 = _P_2π_R_2

to this excess of pressure inside, the tiny fog droplets are rigid enough to behave like solids. When an ice-skater skate over the surface of the ice, some ice melts due to the pressure exerted by the sharp metal edges of the skates, the tiny droplets of water act as rigid ball- bearings and help the skaters to run along smoothly. -->

<!-- ## Capillarity -->


<!-- The word ‘capilla’ means hair in Latin. If the tubes were hair thin, then the rise would be very large. It means that the tube having a very small diameter is called a ‘capillary tube’. When a glass capillary tube open at both ends is dipped vertically in water, the water in the tube will rise above the level of water in the vessel. In case of mercury, the liquid is depressed in the tube below the level of mercury in the vessel (shown in Figure 7.29). In a liquid whose angle of contact with solid is less than 90°, suffers capillary rise. On the other hand, in a liquid whose angle of contact is greater than 90°, suffers capillary fall (Table 7.4). The rise or fall of a liquid in a narrow tube is called capillarity or capillary action. Depending on the diameter of the capillary tube, liquid rises or falls to different heights.

**Practical applications of capillarity** • Due to capillary action, oil rises in the

cotton within an earthen lamp. Likewise, sap rises from the roots of a plant to its leaves and branches.

• Absorption of ink by a blotting paper • Capillary action is also ess ntial for the

tear fluid from the eye to drain constantly. • Cotton dresses are preferred in summer

because cotton dresses have fine pores which act as capillaries for sweat. -->

<!-- ## Surface Tension by capillary rise method -->


<!-- The pressure difference across a curved liquid-air interface is the basic factor behind the rising up of water in a narrow tube (influence of gravity is ignored). The capillary rise is more dominant in the case of very fine tubes. But this phenomenon is the outcome of the force of surface tension. In order to arrive a relation between the capillary rise (_h_) and surface tension (_T_),

(a)

(c)  

consider a capillary tube which is held vertically in a beaker containing water; the water rises in the capillary tube to a height _h_ due to surface tension (Figure 7.31). The surface tension force FT, acts along the tangent at the point of contact downwards and its reaction force upwards. Surface tension _T_, is resolved into two components i) Horizontal component _T_ sinθ and ii) Vertical component _T_ cosθ acting upwards, all along the whole circumference of the meniscus.

Total upward force = (_T_ cosθ) (2πr) = 2πr_T_ cosθ

## Applications of surface tension


• Mosquitoes lay their eggs on the surface of water. To reduce the surface tension of water, a small amount of oil is poured. This breaks the elastic film of water surface and eggs are killed by drowning.

• Chemical engineers must finely adjust the surface tension of the liquid, so it forms droplets of designed size and so it adheres to the surface without smearing. This is used in desktop printing, to paint automobiles and decorative items.

• Specks of dirt get removed when detergents are added to hot water while washing clothes because surface tension is reduced.

• A fabric can be made waterproof, by adding suitable waterproof material (wax) to the fabric. This increases the angle of contact.

<!-- 
In order to discuss the mass flow rate through a pipe, it is necessary to assume that the flow of fluid is steady, the flow of the fluid is said to be steady if at any given point, the velocity of each passing fluid particle remains constant with respect to time. Under this condition, the path taken by the fluid particle is a streamline.

Consider a pipe AB of varying cross sectional area _a_1 and _a_2 such that _a_1 > _a_2\. A non-viscous and incompressible liquid flows steadily through the pipe, with velocities _v_1 and _v_2 in area _a_1 and _a_2, respectively as shown in Figure 7.32.

Let m2 be the mass of fluid flowing through section _B_ in time Δ_t_, _m_2 = (_a_2_v_2Δ_t_) ρ

For an incompressible liquid, mass is conserved _m_1 = _m_2

_a_1_v_1 Δ_t_ ρ = _a_2_v_2Δ_t_ ρ

_a_1_v_1 = _a_2_v_2 ⇒ _a_ _v_ = constant (7.35)

which is called the equation of continuity and it is a statement of conservation of mass in the flow of fluids.  

In general, _a v =_ constant, which means that the volume flux or flow rate remains constant throughout the pipe. In other words, the smaller the cross section, greater will be the velocity of the fluid. -->

Let us consider a flow of liquid through a pipe AB as shown in Figure 7.33. Let _V_ be the volume of the liquid when it enters _A_ in a time _t_ which is equal to the volume of the liquid leaving _B_ in the same time. Let _aA_, _vA_ and P_A_ be the area of cross section of the tube, velocity of the liquid and pressure exerted by the liquid at _A_ respectively.

Let the force exerted by the liquid at _A_ is _FA_ = _PAaA_

Distance travelled by the liquid in time _t_ is _d_ = _vA_ _t_

Therefore, the work done is _W_ = _FAd_ = _PAaAvA_ _t_

But _aAvAt_ = _aAd_ =_V_, volume of the liquid entering at _A_. Thus, the work done is the pressure energy (at _A_), _W_ = _FAd_ = _PAV_

The above equation is the consequence of the conservation of energy which is true until there is no loss of energy due to friction. But in practice, some energy is lost due to friction. This arises due to the fact that in a fluid flow, the layers flowing with different velocities exert frictional forces on each other. This loss of energy is generally converted into heat energy.

**Applications of Bernoulli’s Theorem**

**(a) Blowing off roofs during wind storm** In olden days, the roofs of the huts or houses were designed with a slope as shown in Figure.7.34. One important scientific reason is that as per the Bernoulli’s principle, it will be safeguarded except roof during storm or cyclone.

**Figure 7.34** Roofs of the huts or houses

**Wind flow**

**P1**

**P2 P2 > P1**

During cyclonic condition, the roof is blown off without damaging the other parts of the house. In accordance with the Bernoulli’s principle, the high wind blowing over the roof creates a low-pressure P1. The pressure under the roof P2 is greater. Therefore, this pressure difference (P2–P1) creates an up thrust and the roof is blown off.

**(b) Aerofoil lift** The wings of an airplane (aerofoil) are so designed that its upper surface is more curved than the lower surface and the front edge is broader than the real edge. As the aircraft moves, the air moves faster above the aerofoil than at the bottom as shown in Figure 7.35. According to Bernoulli’s Principle, the pressure of air below is greater than above, which creates an upthrust called the dynamic lift to the aircraft.

**(d) Venturimeter** This device is used to measure the rate of flow (or say flow speed) of the incompressible  

fluid flowing through a pipe. It works on the principle of Bernoulli’s theorem. It consists of two wider tubes A and A' (with cross sectional area A) connected by a narrow tube B (with cross sectional area _a_). A manometer in the form of U-tube is also attached between the wide and narrow tubes as shown in Figure7.37. The manometer contains a liquid of density ‘ρm’.

Let P1 be the pressure of the fluid at the wider region of the tube A. Let us assume that the fluid of density ‘ρ’ flows from the pipe with speed ‘_v_1’ and into the narrow region, its speed increases to ‘_v_2’. According to the Bernoulli’s equation, this increase in speed is accompanied by a decrease in the fluid pressure P2 at the narrow region of the tube B. Therefore, the pressure difference between the tubes A and B is noted by measuring the height difference (Δ_P_ \= _P_1−_P_2) between the surfaces of the manometer liquid.

From the equation of continuity, we can say that A_v_1 = _a v_2 which means that

_v_2 = _A a_
