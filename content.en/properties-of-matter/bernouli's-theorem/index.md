# BERNOULLI’S THEOREM

## Equation of continuity
In order to discuss the mass flow rate through a pipe, it is necessary to assume that the flow of fluid is steady, the flow of the fluid is said to be steady if at any given point, the velocity of each passing fluid particle remains constant with respect to time. Under this condition, the path taken by the fluid particle is a streamline. Consider a pipe AB of varying cross sectional area a1 and a2 such that {{< katex >}} a_1 {{< /katex >}}{{< katex >}} > a_2 {{< /katex >}}. A non-viscous and incompressible liquid flows steadily through the pipe, with velocities {{< katex >}} v_1 {{< /katex >}} and {{< katex >}} v_2 {{< /katex >}} in area {{< katex >}} a_1 {{< /katex >}}and {{< katex >}} a_2 {{< /katex >}}, respectively as shown in Figure 7.32.

**Fig 7.32** A streamlined flow of fluid through a 

Let m1 be the mass of fluid flowing through section A in time Δt, {{< katex >}} m_1 =(a_1 v_1\ Δt)ρ {{< /katex >}} Let m2 be the mass of fluid flowing through section B in time Δt, {{< katex >}} m_2 = (a_2 v_2\ Δt) ρ {{< /katex >}} For an incompressible liquid, mass is conserved {{< katex >}} m_1 = m_2 {{< /katex >}}

 {{< katex display >}}
a_1 v_1\ Δt\ ρ = a_2 v_2\ Δt\ ρ
{{< /katex >}}


 {{< katex display >}}
a_1 v_1 = a_2 v_2 ⇒ a v = constant (7.35)
{{< /katex >}}

which is called the equation of continuity and it is a statement of conservation of mass in the flow of fluids.  

In general, _a v =_ constant, which means that the volume flux or flow rate remains constant throughout the pipe. In other words, the smaller the cross section, greater will be the velocity of the fluid.

**EXAMPLE 7.14**
In a normal adult, the average speed of the blood through the aorta (radius _r_ = 0.8 cm) is 0.33 ms<sup>–1</sup>. From the aorta, the blood goes into major arteries, which are 30 in number, each of radius 0.4 cm. Calculate the speed of the blood through the arteries.

**_Solution_**

{{< katex display >}}
a_1 v_1 = 30\ a_2 v_2 ⇒ π r_1^{2} v_1 = 30 π r_2^{2} v_2 {{< /katex >}}

{{< katex display >}}
v_2 = \frac{1}{30} (\frac{r_1}{r_2})^{2} v_1{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex display >}}
⇒ v_2 = \frac{1}{30} \times (\frac{0.8 \times {10}^{-2}m}{0.4 \times {10}^{-2}m})^{2} \times ({0.33 ms^{-1}}){{< /katex >}}


{{< katex display >}}
v_2 =0.044 ms^{-1}
{{< /katex >}}

## Pressure, kinetic and potential energy of liquids

A liquid in a steady flow can possess three kinds of energy. They are (1) Kinetic energy, (2) Potential energy, and (3) Pressure energy, respectively.

1. **Kinetic energy:** The kinetic energy of a liquid of mass _m_ moving with a velocity _v_ is given by


{{< katex display >}}
KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^{2}
{{< /katex >}}

The kinetic energy per unit mass =
{{< katex display >}}
\frac{KE}{m} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} mv^{2}}{m} = \frac{1}{2}v^{2}
{{< /katex >}}

Similarly, the kinetic energy per unit volume
{{< katex display >}}
\frac{KE}{volume} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} mv^{2}}{V} = \frac{1}{2} \ (\frac{m}{V})v^{2} = \frac{1}{2}ρv^{2}
{{< /katex >}}


2. **Potential energy:** The potential energy of a liquid of mass _m_ at a height _h_ above the ground level is given by

{{< katex display >}}
{PE} ={mgh} 
{{< /katex >}}

The potential energy per unit mass
{{< katex display >}}
\frac{PE}{m} = \frac{mgh}{m} = {gh} 
{{< /katex >}}

Similarly, the potential energy per unit
{{< katex display >}}
volume = \frac{PE}{volume} = \frac{mgh}{V} = \frac{m}{V}{gh} = ρgh 
{{< /katex >}}

3. **Pressure energy:** The energy acquired by a fluid by applying pressure on the fluid. We know that

{{< katex display >}}
Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area} ⇒ Force = Pressure × Area
{{< /katex >}}


{{< katex display >}}
F × d = (P\ A) × d = P (A × d)
{{< /katex >}}


{{< katex display >}}
⇒ F × d = W = P\ V = pressure\ energy
{{< /katex >}}

Therefore, pressure energy, {{< katex >}}
E_P = PV
{{< /katex >}}

The pressure energy per unit mass =
{{< katex display >}}
\frac{E_P}{m} = \frac{PV}{m} = \frac{P}
{\frac{m}{V}}= \frac{P}{ρ}{{< /katex >}}
Similarly, the pressure energy per unit

{{< katex display >}}
volume = \frac{E_P}{Volume} = \frac{Pv}{V} =P
{{< /katex >}}


## Bernoulli’s theorem and its applications

In 1738, the Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli developed a relationship for the flow of fluid through a pipe of varying cross section. He proposed a theorem for the streamline flow of a liquid based on the law of conservation of energy. 

**Bernoulli’s theorem** According to Bernoulli’s theorem, the sum of pressure energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy per unit mass of an incompressible, non-viscous fluid in a streamlined flow remains a constant. Mathematically,

{{< katex display >}}
\frac{P}{ρ} + \frac{1}{2}v^{2} +gh = constant (7.36)
{{< /katex >}}

This is known as Bernoulli’s equation. 

**Proof:**

![alt text](../img42.png)

**Figure 7.33** Flow of liquid through a pipe AB

Let us consider a flow of liquid through a pipe AB as shown in Figure 7.33. Let _V_ be the volume of the liquid when it enters _A_ in a time _t_ which is equal to the volume of the liquid leaving _B_ in the same time. Let {{< katex >}} a_A, v_A {{< /katex >}} and {{< katex >}}P_A {{< /katex >}}be the area of cross section of the tube, velocity of the liquid and pressure exerted by the liquid at _A_ respectively.

Let the force exerted by the liquid at A is
{{< katex display >}}F_A = P_A a_A{{< /katex >}}

Distance travelled by the liquid in time _t_ is 
{{< katex display >}}d = v_A\ t{{< /katex >}}

Therefore, the work done is 
{{< katex display >}}W= F_A d  = P_A a_A V_A t{{< /katex >}}

But {{< katex >}}a_A v_A t = a_A d = V{{< /katex >}}, volume of the liquid entering at _A_. 
Thus, the work done is the pressure energy (at _A_), {{< katex display >}}W= F_A d  = P_A V {{< /katex >}}


Pressure energy per unit volume at A

{{< katex display >}}
\frac{Pressure\ energy} {volume} = \frac{P_A \ {V}}{V} = P_A
 {{< /katex >}}
  
Pressure energy per unit mass at A
{{< katex display >}}
\frac{Pressure\ energy} { mass} = \frac{P_A \ {V}}{m} = \frac{P_A}{\frac{m}{V}}= \frac{P_A}{ρ}
 {{< /katex >}}

Since m is the mass of the liquid entering at A in a given time, therefore, pressure energy of the liquid at A is

{{< katex display >}}
E_{P_A} = {P_A \ {V}} = {P_A}{V} \times (\frac{m}{m})= {m}\frac{P_A}{ρ}
 {{< /katex >}}

Potential energy of the liquid at A,
{{< katex display >}}
 PE_A = mg\ h_A,
 {{< /katex >}}

Due to the flow of liquid, the kinetic energy of the liquid at A,

{{< katex display >}}
KE_A = \frac{1}{2} m\ v^{2}_A
 {{< /katex >}} 

Therefore, the total energy due to the flow of liquid at A, {{< katex >}}
E_A = E_{P_A} + KE_A + PE_A
 {{< /katex >}} 


{{< katex display >}}
E_A =m\frac{P_A}{ρ}+ \frac{1}{2} mv^{2}_A + mg\ h_A
 {{< /katex >}} 

Similarly, let {{< katex >}}
a_B, a_B {{< /katex >}},and {{< katex >}} P_B {{< /katex >}} be the area of cross section of the tube, velocity of the liquid, and pressure exerted by the liquid at _B_. Calculating the total energy at {{< katex >}}E_B {{< /katex >}}, we get


{{< katex display >}}
E_B =m\frac{P_B}{ρ}+ \frac{1}{2} mv^{2}_B + mg\ h_B
 {{< /katex >}} 

From the law of conservation of energy,
{{< katex display >}}
 E_A = E_B
{{< /katex >}}

{{< katex display >}}
m\frac{P_A}{ρ}+ \frac{1}{2} mv^{2}_A + mg\ h_A = m\frac{P_B}{ρ}+ \frac{1}{2} mv^{2}_B + mg\ h_B
 {{< /katex >}} 

{{< katex display >}}
\frac{P_A}{ρ}+ \frac{1}{2} mv^{2}_A + g\ h_A = \frac{P_B}{ρ}+ \frac{1}{2} mv^{2}_B + g\ h_B = constant
 {{< /katex >}}

Thus, the above equation can be written as

{{< katex display >}}
\frac{P}{ρg}+ \frac{1}{2} \frac{{v}^{2}}{g} + h =constant
 {{< /katex >}}

The above equation is the consequence of the conservation of energy which is true until there is no loss of energy due to friction. But in practice, some energy is lost due to friction. This arises due to the fact that in a fluid flow, the layers flowing with different velocities exert frictional forces on each other. This loss of energy is generally converted into heat energy. Therefore, Bernoulli’s relation is strictly valid for fluids with zero viscosity or non-viscous liquids. Notice that when the liquid flows through a horizontal pipe, then {{< katex >}}
h = 0 ⇒ \frac{P}{ρg} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{{v}^{2}}{g}
=constant
 {{< /katex >}}

**Applications of Bernoulli’s Theorem**

**(a) Blowing off roofs during wind storm** In olden days, the roofs of the huts or houses were designed with a slope as shown in Figure.7.34. One important scientific reason is that as per the Bernoulli’s principle, it will be safeguarded except roof during storm or cyclone.
![Alt text](../img43.png)

**Figure 7.34** Roofs of the huts or houses

During cyclonic condition, the roof is blown off without damaging the other parts of the house. In accordance with the Bernoulli’s principle, the high wind blowing over the roof creates a low-pressure {{< katex >}} P_1 {{< /katex >}}. The pressure under the roof{{< katex >}} P_2 {{< /katex >}} is greater. Therefore, this pressure difference {{< katex >}} (P_2-P_1) {{< /katex >}}creates an up thrust and the roof is blown off.

**(b) Aerofoil lift** 
The wings of an airplane (aerofoil) are so designed that its upper surface is more curved than the lower surface and the front edge is broader than the real edge. As the aircraft moves, the air moves faster above the aerofoil than at the bottom as shown in Figure 7.35. According to Bernoulli’s Principle, the pressure of air below is greater than above, which creates an upthrust called the dynamic lift to the aircraft.

**Figure 7.35 Aerofoil lift**

Pressure exerted by faster-moving air

**(c) Bunsen burner** 
In this, the gas comes out of the nozzle with high velocity, hence the pressure in the stem decreases. So outside air reaches into the burner through an air vent and the mixture of air and gas gives a blue flame as shown in Figure 7.36.
![Alt text](../img46.png)
**Figure 7.36 Bunsen burner**


**(d) Venturimeter** 
This device is used to measure the rate of flow (or say flow speed) of the incompressible  fluid flowing through a pipe. It works on the principle of Bernoulli’s theorem. It consists of two wider tubes A and A' (with cross sectional area A) connected by a narrow tube B (with cross sectional area _a_). A manometer in the form of U-tube is also attached between the wide and narrow tubes as shown in Figure7.37. The manometer contains a liquid of density ‘ρm’.
![Alt text](../img45.png)

**Figure 7.37** A schematic diagram of venturimeter
Let {{< katex >}} P_1 {{< /katex >}}be the pressure of the fluid at the wider region of the tube A. Let us assume that the fluid of density ‘ρ’ flows from the pipe with speed {{< katex >}} ‘v_1’ {{< /katex >}} and into the narrow region, its speed increases to {{< katex >}} ‘v_2’ {{< /katex >}}. According to the Bernoulli’s equation, this increase in speed is accompanied by a decrease in the fluid pressure {{< katex >}} P_2 {{< /katex >}}at the narrow region of the tube B. Therefore, the pressure difference between the tubes A and B is noted by measuring the height difference {{< katex >}} (ΔP = P_1−P_2) {{< /katex >}} between the surfaces of the manometer liquid. From the equation of continuity, we can say that {{< katex >}} A v_1 = a\ v_2 {{< /katex >}} which means that

{{< katex display >}} 
v_2 = \frac{A}{a}\ v_1.
{{< /katex >}}

Using Bernoulli’s equation,

{{< katex display >}} 
P_1 + ρ \frac{v_1}{2} = P_2 + ρ \frac{{v_2}^{2}}{2} = P_2 + ρ \frac{1}{2} ({\frac{A}{a}v_1})^{2}
{{< /katex >}}

From the above equation, the pressure difference
{{< katex display >}} 
ΔP = P_1 – P_2 = ρ \frac{v_1^{2}}{2} (\frac{{A}^{2} -{a}^{2}}{a^{2}})
{{< /katex >}}

Thus, the speed of flow of fluid at the wide end of the tube A

{{< katex display >}} 
{v_1}^{2}= \frac{{2}({∆P}){a^{2}}} 
{ρ\ (A^{2}-{a^{2}})}  
⇒ {v_1}^{2}= \sqrt \frac{{2}({∆P}){a^{2}}} 
{ρ\ (A^{2}-{a^{2}})}  
{{< /katex >}}

The volume of the liquid flowing out per second is

{{< katex display >}} 
{V}= Av_1= A\sqrt \frac{{2}({∆P}){a^{2}}} 
{ρ\ (A^{2}-{a^{2}})}  
= aA \sqrt \frac{{2}({∆P})} 
{ρ\ (A^{2}-{a^{2}})}  
{{< /katex >}}



**(e) Other applications** 
This Bernoulli’s concept is mainly used in the design of carburetor of automobiles, filter pumps, atomizers, and sprayers. For example, the carburetor has a very fine channel called nozzle through which the air is allowed to flow in larger speed. In this case, the pressure is lowered at the narrow neck and in turn, the required fuel or petrol is sucked into the chamber so as to provide the correct mixture of air and fuel necessary for ignition process.


**Activity**
A bottle is filled with thermocol balls. One end of a flexible tube is kept inside the bottle immersed inside the balls. The free end is rotated and we find the balls sprayed all around. This explains the working of an atomizer or sprayer.
